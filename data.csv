People supervising these systems often rely on information relayed by the system to make any decisions, which places a burden on the system to self-assess its proficiency and communicate the relevant information. Proficiency self-assessment benefits from an understanding of how well the models and decision mechanisms used by robot align with the world and a problem holder’s goals. This paper makes three contributions: (1) Identifying the importance of goal, system, and environment for proficiency assessment; (2) Completing the phrase “proficient ‹preposition›” using an understanding of proficiency span; and (3) Proposing the proficiency dependency graph to represent causal relationships that contribute to failures, which highlights how one can reason about their own proficiency given alterations in goal, system, and environment. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Environment; Goal(s); Intelligent agents; Proficiency; Self-assessment; System","Drones; Human engineering; Intelligent systems; Real time systems; Security of data; Autonomous systems; Causal relationships; Decision mechanism; Dependency graphs; Real-time application; Self assessment; Social robots",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088238482

A relevant question in control engineering education is: How to close the gap between theory and practice? Once subjects are introduced in theoretical classes, students want to know about its practical use. Thus, it is important to introduce theoretical control concepts with practical experiments, enabling students to easily test and validate the theory. An Arduino based temperature control laboratory (TCLab) is deployed in this study as a portable kit providing students with a simple and effective means to test some feedback control techniques.

Structural DSE of turbomachinery compressor blades is often challenging because the large number of design variables make it difficult to learn the effect that each variable has upon the stress contours. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the stress contours is used as a way to understand how the stress contours change over the design space. Two methods are introduced to address the challenge of understanding how the stress changes over a large number of variables. First, a two-point correlation is applied to relate the design variables to the scores of each principal component. Second, a coupling of the stress and coordinate location of each node in PCA is developed which also indicates how the stress variations relate to geometric variations. These provide insight to how design variables influence the stress. It is shown how these methods use PCA as DSE tools to better explore the structural design space of compressor blades. Better DSE can improve compressor blades and the computational cost needed for their design.

While there is significant research regarding user motivation on dating apps such as Bumble, Tinder, and Match.com, there is no published research that discusses the motivations of Mutual app users. Developed as a dating app to target members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Mutual allows users to find potential mates who share their religious background and specify their relationship readiness (from “Into Dating I Guess” to “Ready for a Ring”). This research aims to illuminate the various motivations, attitudes, and opinions of Mutual app users through Q methodology, which identifies perceptual groups among homogeneous populations through a factor analysis of participants’ agreement with similar statements regarding Mutual use. Findings indicated four factor groups: the Relationship Readies (i.e., those serious about dating), the Swipeaholics (i.e., those looking for entertainment), the Faithless (i.e., those who felt pressured to use Mutual), and the Eligible Optimists (i.e., those who saw the app as a convenient, entertaining way to date). Different from other research on dating apps, this study indicates that people may use a niche religion-focused dating app to find individuals with similar moral values or due to external pressure from others.

This, in turn, is making feasible new tools such as immersive, collaborative, design environments that reflect the collaborative environment of drafting tables while still providing all the power of modern, computer-based, design tools. However, before such an environment can be fully realized, basic issues surrounding collaboration in VR such as cybersickness and disorientation must be more fully addressed. This work presents the results of an experimental study conducted to characterize the trade-offs between different styles of transitioning collaborators to a shared view in an immersive virtual environment. The experimental task consisted of asking participants to identify in which quadrant of the car specific components were located. Quadrant identification was performed after a participant's virtual location was transitioned to a shared view location focused on the component to identify. The study was conducted with 45 participants who provided 1890 transition response datapoints. Analysis of these results suggests that, in many cases, collaborators are willing to experience some mild cybersickness in order to reduce their disorientation and improve both confidence and accuracy of component location identification. The results also support the recommendation that the best practice is to provide support for multiple transition styles and allow collaborators to select their preference. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Collaboration; Cybersickness; Immersive; Spatial awareness; Viewpoint; Viewpoint sharing; Virtual Reality","Economic and social effects; Location; Collaborative environments; Design environment; Immersive virtual environments; Immersive virtual reality; Location identification; Multiple transitions; Specific component; View locations; Virtual reality",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091196229

Current industrial methods generally utilize monoethanolamine for CO2 capture; however, the CO2 regeneration requires a high temperature and energy demand during every adsorption/desorption process, along with material losses. Many solid amines with high capture capacity and stability are developed as adsorbents to overcome the limitations. However, the environmental impacts caused by adsorbents themselves are not holistically considered and discussed; meanwhile, material syntheses and consumptions are also associated with CO2 emission. To determine the environmental impacts and identify hotspots of novel CO2 capture adsorbents, two carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine, physically adsorbed and covalently bonded, were compared with traditional monoethanolamine method using life cycle assessment. The carbon payback periods were also analyzed to gain understanding on whether the currently evaluated novel materials are suitable for industrial application. Results suggest that, material usage, especially carbon nanotubes, contributes the majority of the overall environmental impacts for both types of carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine. Meanwhile, their carbon payback periods are over 40 times longer than monoethanolamine during the synthesis phase. However, the energy consumption of physically adsorbed polyethyleneimine saves up to 60% compared to monoethanolamine in every adsorption/desorption cycle due to its lower heat capacity. In addition, the rate of cumulative CO2 remission for carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine is twice higher than monoethanolamine, indicating the potential application for industrial CO2 capture. Overall, our study indicates that current status of solid amine has a potential in CO2 capture, but requires much improvements.

The process remains to be implemented on a wide scale in the automotive and aerospace industries, partially due to the relatively short number of welds producible by a toolset, prior to needing cleaning. In the following work, an investigation was conducted to better understand this limitation. First, the effective tool life of a steel toolset was quantified. Experiments showed that less than 60 consecutive welds could be made before the toolset seized and required cleaning. To better understand the conditions contributing so such a short tool life, thermocouples were used in subsequent experiments, to measure the temperatures achieved at various locations in the weld. Peak weld temperature increased with longer cycle times and decreased with shorter cycle times. During the experiments, it was noted that weld temperatures in excess of 500 °C were observed at weld center. At these high temperatures, the authors anticipate that intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are able to grow on tool surfaces. A rough, existing model of IMC growth in an Fe-Al system predicted IMC growth on the same order of magnitude of the tool clearances, supporting the anticipation that IMC growth is a factor in the observed, short tool life between cleanings. Following this analysis, future evaluation of less re-active tool materials is recommended. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","FSpW; Refill friction stir spot welding; RFSSW; Temperature; Tool life","Aerospace industry; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum coated steel; Automotive industry; Cleaning; Spot welding; Thermocouples; Tool steel; Welds; Effective tool; Friction stir spot welding; High temperature; Steel tools; Thin sheet; Tool materials; Tool surfaces; Weld temperature; Friction stir welding",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090035826

For these experiments, the standard clay backing material was replaced with a 20% clear ballistic gel to provide visual access to the back-face.

The strain response was compared to the BFD of the Kevlar sample. The BFD was measured through the clear ballistic gel using two high speed cameras recording at 100,000 fps.

The starting point of the formulation is the modified Hellinger–Reissner variational principle with independent displacement, membrane, and shear strains as the unknown fields. To overcome locking, the strain variables are interpolated with lower-order spline bases while the variations of the strain variables are interpolated with the corresponding Bézier dual bases. Leveraging the orthogonality property of the Bézier dual basis, the strain variables are condensed out of the system with only a slight increase in the bandwidth of the resulting linear system. The condensed approach preserves the accuracy of the non-condensed mixed approach but with fewer degrees of freedom.

This study employs controlled laboratory experiments to examine the impact of real-time feedback on production quantities, first time yield percentages, and rework percentages. Drawing on concepts from speed-accuracy tradeoffs, we study four types of feedback: speed, accuracy, joint speed and accuracy, and yields. Laboratory activities focus on the repetitive task of converting paper-based medical records to electronic data formats. These tasks are critical inputs to data analytics and are similar in nature to simple independent manufacturing and service tasks. We study feedback effects in a setting critical to practice but rarely studied in research, where workers are incentivized for both speed and quality as they perform production tasks that explicitly allow rework. The results show that production yields worsen under speed feedback but improve under each form of quality-containing feedback. Results also show that each form of quality-containing feedback increases the proportion of correctly reworked to produced errors through different mechanisms of increased error fixing, decreased error production, or both. © 2020 Production and Operations Management Society","performance feedback; production yields; quality-speed tradeoffs; rework; speed-accuracy tradeoffs",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088566580

In this work, an experimental prototype of this concept is realized and its performance is analyzed. In particular, we demonstrate the capability of maintaining a spacecraft component at a desired operating temperature through the expansion and contraction of a collapsible radiator to control radiative heat loss. Four aluminum panels are connected via a flexible hinge constructed from interwoven copper wires and suspended from an actuating framework. The radiator panels are connected to a heated aluminum block. The radiator is placed in a vacuum environment with cooled surroundings (173 K) and the total radiative cooling power is determined as a function of radiator actuation position for a constant aluminum block temperature. As the radiator actuates from extended to collapsed, the heat transfer decreases and the fin efficiency increases. For a limited actuation range, the four-panel radiator exhibits a turn-down ratio (largest cooling power / smallest cooling power) of 1.31. A numerical model validated in this work predicts a turn-down ratio of 2.27 for actuation over the full range of radiator positions in surroundings at 4 K. Future revisions that exhibit an increase in panel and hinge thermal conductivities and utilizing eight panels would yield a turn-down ratio of 6.01.

Specifically, a two-stage process was used to maximize the use of the carbon in coal or increase the carbon monoxide yield or lower carbon dioxide and methane yields. Carbon dioxide-char gasification in the absence of water can generate carbon monoxide with near-zero methane, which is desired to produce high-carbon and low-hydrogen chemicals such as oxalic acid through catalytic carbon monoxide coupling and hydrolysis. The technology is applicable to any coal, although Power River Basin (PRB) coal is used as an example feedstock in this research Also, the sodium-iron catalyst can accelerate not only the reaction kinetics in both stages but also increase the hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratio in the syngas produced in the second stage. In other words, the catalyst is a multifunctional agent, which can not only intensify the overall coal process efficiency but also improve the qualities of the desired syngas products and reduce carbon dioxide emission. Thus, In the 1st stage, the catalysts can significantly reduce the CO2-char gasification by as high as 75.00%. In the 2nd stage, the H2/CO ratio of ideal syngas is ∼2:1 with near-0 CH4 generation and the CH4 production can be reduced as high as 61.29% for the CO2–H2O-Char coal gasification. The activation energy for the 2nd stage is reduced by as high as 35.43% than that of raw coal without use Na–Fe catalyst. The overall carbon footprint reduction for the study is reduced by 87.33% in the 1st stage and 96.77% compared to the direct coal combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Catalysis; CO2 reduction; Coal; Gasification; Ideal syngas; Pyrolysis","Activation energy; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Carbon footprint; Carbon monoxide; Catalysts; Coal; Global warming; Iron research; Methane; Oxalic acid; Reaction kinetics; Synthesis gas; Synthesis gas manufacture; Carbon and hydrogens; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon footprint reductions; Char gasification; Multifunctional agents; Process efficiency; Syngas production; Two-stage process; Coal combustion",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084075876

The filter fuses data from an inertial measurement unit and altimeter with relative-pose updates from a keyframe-based visual odometry or laser scan-matching algorithm. Because the global position and heading states of the vehicle are unobservable in the absence of global measurements such as GPS, the filter in this article estimates the state with respect to a local frame that is colocated with the odometry keyframe. As a result, the odometry update provides nearly direct measurements of the relative vehicle pose, making those states observable. Recent publications have rigorously documented the theoretical advantages of such an observable parameterization, including improved consistency, accuracy, and system robustness, and have demonstrated the effectiveness of such an approach during prolonged multirotor flight tests. This article complements this prior work by providing a complete, self-contained, tutorial derivation of the relative MEKF, which has been thoroughly motivated but only briefly described to date. This article presents several improvements and extensions to the filter while clearly defining all quaternion conventions and properties used, including several new useful properties relating to error quaternions and their Euler-angle decomposition.

Using algal-bacterial systems helps to reach a cost-efficient treatment method by eliminating mechanical aeration, since algae produce the oxygen needed for treatment process. In this study, two groups of experiments were performed for domestic wastewater treatment processes. For the first group, semi-continuous microalgae-bacterial photo-bioreactors were cultivated. Chlorella Vulgaris and activated sludge (AS) were used as microalgae and bacterial inoculums, respectively. The effect of different algae and AS ratios on the chemical oxygen demand (COD), N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3− removal was studied. The removal efficiency of COD was above 93 % for the three tested algae and AS inoculum ratios (5:1, 1:1, and 1:5). The reactor with algae: AS inoculum ratio of 5:1 achieved the highest final N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3− removal efficiencies (88.0 ± 1.0 % and 84.0 ± 1.0 %, respectively). Furthermore, the highest biomass concentration (1.96 g L-1 from initial amount of 0.3 g L-1) was observed in the reactor with algae: AS ratio of 5:1. The ratio of 5:1 (algae: AS) was found as the optimum ratio which promoted the cooperation between microalgae and AS for nutrient removal. For the second group of experiments, the optimum ratio of 5:1 (algae: AS) was used in a membrane bioreactor, and the results showed that this reactor enhanced the final removal efficacies from 88 to 98 % and from 84 to 89 % for N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3-, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Algal-bacterial culture; Membrane bioreactor; Microalgae; Photo-bioreactor; Wastewater treatment",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083197890

This paper explores current practices in industries used by design engineers to consider the social impact of products. Forty-six individuals from 34 different companies were interviewed to discover what disconnects exist between academia and industry when considering a product's social impact. These interviews were also used to discover how social impact might be considered in a design setting moving forward. This is not a study to find “the state of the art,” but considers the average engineering professional's work to design products in various industries. Social impact assessments (SIA) and social life cycle assessments (SLCA) are two of the most common processes discussed in the literature to evaluate social impact, both generally and in products. Interestingly, these processes did not arise in any discussion in interviews, despite respondents affirming that they do consider social impact in the product design. Processes used to predict social impact, rather than simply evaluate, were discussed by the respondents. These tended to be developed within the company and often related to industry imposed government regulations. To build on this study, the findings herein should be further validated for executives, managers, and engineers. A study specific to these roles should be designed to understand the disconnect better. Additionally, processes should be developed to assist engineers in considering the social impact of their products. Work should also be done to help educate engineers and their leaders on the value of considering the social impact in product design.

State-of-the-art algorithms for calculating the relative pose between two images use matching features to estimate the essential matrix. The essential matrix is then decomposed into the relative rotation and normalized translation between frames. To be robust to noise and feature match outliers, these methods generate a large number of essential matrix hypotheses from randomly selected minimal subsets of feature pairs, and then score these hypotheses on all feature pairs. Alternatively, the algorithm introduced in this paper calculates relative pose hypotheses by directly optimizing the rotation and normalized translation between frames, rather than calculating the essential matrix and then performing the decomposition. The resulting algorithm improves computation time by an order of magnitude. If an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is available, it is used to seed the optimizer, and in addition, we reuse the best hypothesis at each iteration to seed the optimizer thereby reducing the number of relative pose hypotheses that must be generated and scored. These advantages greatly speed up performance and enable the algorithm to run in real-time on low cost embedded hardware. We show application of our algorithm to visual multi-target tracking (MTT) in the presence of parallax and demonstrate its real-time performance on a 640 480 video sequence captured on a UAV. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.","Aerial robotics; epipolar geometry; multi-target tracking; pose estimation; unmanned aircraft systems; vision-based flight","Aircraft detection; Clutter (information theory); Geometrical optics; Matrix algebra; Video recording; Embedded hardware; Epipolar geometry; Inertial measurement unit; Multi-target tracking; Pose estimation algorithm; Real time performance; Relative rotation; State-of-the-art algorithms; Iterative methods",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088045861

Unfortunately, the methodology for in vivo measurements of whole-arm movements using EM sensors is not well described in the literature, making it difficult to perform new measurements and all but impossible to make meaningful comparisons between studies. The recommendations of the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) have provided a great service, but by necessity they do not provide clear guidance or standardization on all required steps. The goal of this paper was to provide a comprehensive methodology for using EM sensors to measure whole-arm movements in vivo. We selected methodological details from past studies that were compatible with the ISB recommendations and suitable for measuring whole-arm movements using EM sensors, filling in gaps with recommendations from our own past experiments. The presented methodology includes recommendations for defining coordinate systems (CSs) and joint angles, placing sensors, performing sensor-to-body calibration, calculating rotation matrices from sensor data, and extracting unique joint angles from rotation matrices. We present this process, including all equations, for both the right and left upper limbs, models with nine or seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF), and two different calibration methods. Providing a detailed methodology for the entire process in one location promotes replicability of studies by allowing researchers to clearly define their experimental methods. It is hoped that this paper will simplify new investigations of whole-arm movement using EM sensors and facilitate comparison between studies. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Peak radiated noise levels correlate with the time when the valve opens and closes, while the noise levels when the valve is completely open are also relatively high. Significant noise ranges between 300 Hz and 3000 Hz. It was hypothesized that increasing the in-tube distance between the flush valve and the bowl in addition to increasing the bend radius of the tube would reduce radiated noise levels. These modifications resulted in a reduction of about 14 dB in the radiated noise during the valve opening and closing in addition to a reduction of about 5 dB while the valve is completely opened. Intermediate results of varying the tube length and bend radius are presented to show their effects on the radiated sound levels. Two tube inserts were designed to fit (1) underneath and (2) behind the toilet in a compact manner.

At the same time, due to their high level of design flexibility, reprogrammable capability, low power consumption, and relatively low cost, the field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are very good candidates to implement the neural networks. Unfortunately, the radiation-induced errors are known to be an issue in static random-access memory (SRAM)-based FPGAs. More specifically, we have seen that particles can change the content of the FPGA's configuration memory, consequently corrupting the implemented circuit and generating the observable errors at the output. Through extensive fault injection, we determine the reliability impact of applying binary quantization to the convolutional layers of neural networks on FPGAs, by analyzing the relationships between model accuracy, resource utilization, performance, error criticality, and radiation cross section. We were able to find that a design with quantized convolutional layers can be 39% less sensitive to radiation, whereas the portion of errors that are considered critical (misclassifications) in the network is increased by 12%. Moreover, we also derive generic equations that consider both accuracy and radiation in order to model the overall failure rate of neural networks. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Field-programmable gate array (FPGA); neural networks; quantization; reliability","Aerospace applications; Convolution; Failure analysis; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Low power electronics; Military applications; Military vehicles; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Random errors; Static random access storage; Binary quantization; Configuration memory; Design flexibility; Low-power consumption; Misclassifications; Reliability impacts; Resource utilizations; Static random access memory; Convolutional neural networks",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088865797

Within this setup, the system observability can be predicted, and the proposed SE can decide between using the static SE (SSE) or the discrete Kalman filter plus SSE-based measurements and time alignment (Forecasting-aided SE). Flexible hybrid SE (FHSE) incorporates both phasor measurement units and supervisory control and data acquisition-based measurements, with different time stamps. The proposed FHSE with detailed modelling of the communication system is motivated by: (i) well-known issues in SSE (time alignment of the measurements, frequent un-observability for fixed SE time stamps etc.); and (ii) the need to model a realistic communication system (calculated communication delays and packet drop probabilities are a part of the proposed FHSE).

Resolution IV 2 (Formula presented.) fractional factorial designs are efficient and require fewer experiments or runs than resolution V or full factorial experiments. However, two-factor interactions are confounded with other two-factor interactions in resolution IV designs and their effects cannot be separated. Follow-up experiments have been recommended in the literature to separate the effects of significant but confounded strings of two-factor interactions in resolution IV designs. Recently, an analysis based on conditional main effects (or CMEs) has been shown to be useful in determining which interaction in a confounded string of two-factor interactions is actually causing the significance without the need for follow-up experiments. In this article, I investigate the value of this method of analysis by comparing its use with the analysis of follow-up experiments using the data from three published experiments where follow-up experiments were used to “de-alias” confounded interactions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","aliased effects; CME analysis; confounding; effect heredity; effect sparsity; hierarchical ordering","Separation; Aliased; CME analysis; confounding; effect heredity; Effect sparsity; Hierarchical order; Factor analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079710734

Because the MMSE equalizer filter coefficients are a function of the carrier frequency offset (CFO), the equivalent discrete-time channel, and the noise variance, reliable estimates of those parameters are required. The CFO is due primarily to the high velocity of the airborne transmitter. Because the equivalent discrete-time channel in aeronautical telemetry is sparse, the performance of the joint estimator based on a sparse channel estimator is superior to the performance of a traditional nonsparse maximum-likelihood-inspired joint estimator. The improvement is seen in lower estimator error variances for the parameters, particularly for the CFO and channel estimate, and in the postequalizer bit-error rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the postequalizer bit-error rate using the sparse estimator is almost as good as that using ideal estimators. © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Aeronautical telemetry; continuous phase modulation (CPM); frequency-selective multipath; shaped offset QPSK (SOQPSK); sparse channel estimation","Bit error rate; Equalizers; Errors; Frequency allocation; Maximum likelihood; Mean square error; Telemetering equipment; Aeronautical telemetry; Carrier frequency offsets; Discrete-time channels; Filter coefficients; Frequency selectivity; Minimum mean squared error equalizers; Reliable estimates; Viable solutions; Parameter estimation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086503084

Previous research found optimal stiffness varies among individuals, however, none has determined the causes of variation both between individuals and running speeds. The primary purpose of this study was to understand how optimal shoe stiffness is affected by running speed. A secondary purpose examined the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics associated with optimal stiffness variation. Six shoe stiffness conditions were manufactured with a carbon fibre plate between the midsole and outsole of a standard running shoe. Twenty-one male runners (mass = 67.1 ± 5.0 kg, height = 178.9 cm ± 4.0 cm, age = 26.4 ± 8.4 years) completed testing at 2.98 m/s and 4.47 m/s in all shoe conditions, measuring metabolic cost, and several biomechanical and anatomical variables. Data were separated by foot strike. At the fast speed, average optimal stiffness was 19.29 ± 5.62 N/mm with a metabolic benefit of 3.02 ± 2.62%. Slow speed average optimal stiffness was 17.04 ± 6.09 N/mm with a metabolic benefit of 1.93 ± 1.82%. Only rearfoot strikers demonstrated a significant increase in optimal stiffness (p =.04) across speeds. There were no correlations between any of the measured anatomical or biomechanical variables and optimal stiffness.

The creation of stable water TLFs, however, is very difficult. In this paper, the realization of thin liquid films of water with custom 3D geometries that persist indefinitely in ambient environments is reported. The wetting films are generated using microscale “mounts” fed by microfluidic channels with small feature sizes and large aspect ratios. These devices are fabricated with a custom 3D printer and resin, which are developed to print high resolution microfluidic geometries. By modifying the 3D-printed polymer to be hydrophilic and taking advantage of well-known wetting principles and capillary effects, self-sustaining microscale “water fountains” are constructed that continuously replenish water lost to evaporation while relying on surface tension to stabilize their shape. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration of stable sub-micron thin liquid films (TLFs) of pure water on curved 3D geometries. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Specifically, we show how social impact categories not previously considered can be identified. The product review resulted in 13,200 data points that were divided into two data sets, one with 8800 data points from which a social impact probability table was created. The remaining data points were then used to validate the table. All data points were then combined to create a final social impact probability table. This table provides insight for how various social impact categories correlate and can assist engineers in expanding their views to include additional social impact objectives and thus achieve a design with broader social impact or a design with minimized unwanted negative social impact.

Growth in BJ applications is driven by the use of finer powders and improved post-processing methods that can produce dense, homogenous final parts. However, understanding of the basic droplet/powder interaction is relatively limited. This paper considers the impact of in-process drying, part geometry, and droplet size on a key printing parameter: binder saturation. Parts of varying thicknesses are printed with a range of saturation levels under various heating conditions. The ratio of the printed part mass to the theoretical part mass is used to detect bleeding. In unheated powder beds, part mass increases linearly with printing saturation levels across the range tested (30 %–130 %). However, when the powder is heated between layers, there is a wide range of print saturation levels (30–80 %) over which increasing binder saturation or droplet volume does not increase the part mass. This stable part mass corresponds to accurate part geometries without bleeding and is likely due to enhanced evaporation of the binder solvent between layers. Smaller droplet volume (42 pl) was also shown to decrease saturation levels in unheated powder bed and in single layer parts. The differences in part mass with print saturation and droplet volume are most pronounced in thin parts. These observations lead to a simple method for determining an appropriate print saturation parameter for a powder/binder combination in thick parts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Binder Jetting; Inkjet printing; Saturation; Stainless Steel","3D printers; Additives; Drying; Ink jet printing; Saturation (materials composition); Stainless steel; Additive manufacturing process; Droplet volume; Drying condition; Heating conditions; Postprocessing methods; Saturation levels; Saturation limits; Saturation parameters; Drops",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079855504

Herein, we report the first fabrication of multiple electrically connected metal—semiconductor junctions on individual DNA origami by location-specific binding of gold and tellurium nanorods. Nanorod attachment to DNA origami was via DNA hybridization for Au and by electrostatic interaction for Te. Electroless gold plating was used to create nanoscale metal—semiconductor interfaces by filling the gaps between Au and Te nanorods. Two-point electrical characterization indicated that the Au—Te—Au junctions were electrically connected, with current—voltage properties consistent with a Schottky junction. DNA-based nanofabrication of metal—semiconductor junctions opens up potential opportunities in nanoelectronics, demonstrating the power of this bottom-up approach.

To explain this, it has been observed that as a network grows certain subsets of the network begin to specialize the function(s) they perform. A recent model of network growth based on this notion of specialization has been able to reproduce some of the most well-known topological features found in real-world networks including right-skewed degree distributions, the small world property, modular as well as hierarchical topology, etc. Here we describe how specialization under this model also effects the spectral properties of a network. This allows us to give the conditions under which a network is able to maintain its dynamics as its topology evolves. Specifically, we show that if a network is intrinsically stable, which is a stronger version of the standard notion of global stability, then the network maintains this type of dynamics as the network evolves. This is one of the first steps toward unifying the rigorous study of the two types of dynamics exhibited by networks. These are the dynamics of a network, which is the topological evolution of the network's structure, modeled here by the process of network specialization, and the dynamics on a network, which is the changing state of the network elements, where the type of dynamics we consider is global stability. The main examples we apply our results to are recurrent neural networks, which are the basis of certain types of machine learning algorithms. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","complex dynamics; Dynamic network; intrinsic stability; recurrent neural network; specialization; spectral properties","Dynamics; Learning algorithms; Topology; Global stability; Hierarchical topology; Network element; Real-world networks; Skewed degree distribution; Spectral properties; Topological evolution; Topological features; Recurrent neural networks",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086901812

As an efficient synthetic basis feature descriptor, SYnthetic BAsis (SYBA) requires low computational complexity and provides accurate matching results. However, the number of matched feature points generated by SYBA suffers from large image scaling and rotation variations. In this paper, we improve SYBA’s scale and rotation invariance by adding an efficient pre-processing operation. The proposed algorithm, SR-SYBA, represents the scale of the feature region with the location of maximum gradient response along the radial direction in Log-polar coordinate system. Based on this scale representation, it normalizes all feature regions to the same reference scale to provide scale invariance. The orientation of the feature region is represented as the orientation of the vector from the center of the feature region to its intensity centroid. Based on this orientation representation, all feature regions are rotated to the same reference orientation to provide rotation invariance. The original SYBA descriptor is then applied to the scale and orientation normalized feature regions for description and matching. Experiment results show that SR-SYBA greatly improves SYBA for image matching applications with scaling and rotation variations. SR-SYBA obtains comparable or better performance in terms of matching rate compared to the mainstream algorithms while still maintains its advantages of using much less storage and simpler computations.

Modelling input data on temperature, particle distribution and gas composition in the radial, axial and angular directions are experimentally gathered in a down-scaled version of a rotary kiln. The model is tested in its capability to predict the radiative intensity and heat flux to the inner wall of the furnace and good agreement was found when compared to measurements. Including the conductive heat transfer through the furnace wall, the model also satisfactorily predicts the intermediate wall temperature. The work also includes a first study on the effect of the incident radiative heat flux to the different surfaces while adding a cold bed material. With further development of the model, it can be used to study the heat transfer in full-scale rotary kilns. © 2020 by the authors.","Discrete-ordinates method; Experiments and modelling; Radiative heat transfer; Rotary kiln","Angular distribution; Brickmaking; Heat flux; Heat radiation; Radiative transfer; Rotary kilns; Absorption and scatterings; Conductive heat transfer; Cylindrical enclosure; Discrete ordinates method; Particle distributions; Radiative heat fluxes; Radiative heat transfer; Radiative transfer equations; 3D modeling",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084286348

Using A-PEGDA, we demonstrate spheroid formation in ultralow adhesion 3D printed wells, and cell migration from spheroids on plasma-treated adherent surfaces.

In order for RFSSW to become a readily implementable welding solution, cycle times must be reduced to an acceptable level, similar to that of well developed, competing spot joining processes. In the present work, an investigation of the RFSSW process is conducted to evaluate factors that have traditionally prevented the process from achieving fast cycle times. Within this investigation, the relationship between cycle time and joint quality is explored, as is the meaning and measurement of cycle time in the RFSSW process. Claims and general sentiment found in prior literature are challenged regarding the potential for high-speed RFSSW joints to be made. The RFSSW weld design-as described by process parameters such as tool feed rate, tool rotational velocity, and plunge depth-is shown through experimentation to affect the loads and torques placed on RFSSW tooling and machines during the welding process. As cycle time is decreased, the load and torque on the toolset are shown to increase. Similarly, as tool rotational velocity is decreased, the load and torque on the toolset is shown to increase. The relationship between machine design limitations and cycle time is also explored. It is demonstrated that welds with cycle times below one second can be produced without compromising material properties, suggesting that high speed RFSSW can be enabled through informed efforts. © 2020 SAE International.

Some social impacts are commonly recognized by the engineering community, such as impacts to a user's health and safety, while other social impacts can be more difficult to recognize, such as impacts on families and gender roles. When engineers make design decisions, without considering social impacts, they can unknowingly cause negative social impacts. Even harming the user and/or society. Despite its challenges, measuring a program's or policy's social impact is a common practice in the field of social sciences. These measurements are made using social impact indicators, which are simply the things observed to verify that true progress is being made. While there are clear benefits to predicting the social impact of an engineered product, it is unclear how engineers should select indicators and build predictive social impact models that are functions of engineering parameters and decisions. This paper introduces a method for selecting social impact indicators and creating predictive social impact models that can help engineers predict and improve the social impact of their products. As a first step in the method, an engineer identifies the product's users, objectives, and requirements. Then, the social impact categories that are related to the product are determined. From each of these categories, the engineer selects several social impact indicators. Finally, models are created for each indicator to predict how a product's parameters will change these indicators. The impact categories and indicators can be translated into product requirements and performance measures that can be used in product development processes. This method is used to predict the social impact of the proposed, expanded U.S. Mexico border wall. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

In recent years however, research in optimization, optimal control, and simulation has enabled some forms of nonlinear model predictive control which find locally optimal solutions. The limiting factor for applying nonlinear MPC for robotics remains the computation necessary to solve the optimization, especially for complex systems and for long time horizons. This letter presents a new solution method which addresses computational concerns related to nonlinear MPC called nonlinear Evolutionary MPC (NEMPC), and then we compare it to several existing methods. These comparisons include simulations on torque-limited robots performing a swing-up task and demonstrate that NEMPC is able to discover complex behaviors to accomplish the task. Comparisons with state-of-the-art nonlinear MPC algorithms show that NEMPC finds high quality control solutions very quickly using a global, instead of local, optimization method. Finally, an application in hardware (a 24 state pneumatically actuated continuum soft robot) demonstrates that this method is tractable for real-time control of high degree of freedom systems. © 2016 IEEE.","control architectures and programming; deep learning in robotics and automation; model learning for control; Optimization and optimal control","Computer graphics; Deep learning; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Graphics processing unit; Nonlinear systems; Predictive control systems; Program processors; Real time control; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; Control architectures and programming; High degree of freedom systems; Model learning; Nonlinear model predictive control; Optimal solutions; Optimization and optimal control; Optimization method; Robotics applications; Model predictive control",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079609089

Three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic focusing was implemented in 10-μm scale microchannel cross-sections made with a single sacrificial layer. HDF is achieved using buffer fluid to sheath the sample fluid, requiring four fluid ports to operate by pressure driven flow. A low-pressure chamber, or pit, formed by etching into a substrate, enables volumetric flow ratio-induced focusing at a low flow velocity. The single layer design simplifies surface micromachining and improves device yield by 1.56 times over previous work. The focusing design was integrated with optical waveguides and used in order to analyze fluorescent signals from beads in fluid flow. The implementation of the focusing scheme was found to narrow the distribution of bead velocity and fluorescent signal, giving rise to 33% more consistent signal. Reservoir effects were observed at low operational vacuum pressures and a balance between optofluidic signal variance and intensity was achieved. The implementation of the design in optofluidic sensors will enable higher detection sensitivity and sample specificity. © 2020 by the authors.","3D hydrodynamic focusing; Biosensor; Lab-on-a-chip; Liquid-core waveguide; Microfluidic; Microscale channel; Optofluidic; Reservoir effect; Single layer","Etching; Flow velocity; Fluorescence; Focusing; Hydrodynamics; Optical waveguides; Surface micromachining; Detection sensitivity; Fluorescent signals; Hydrodynamic focusing; Optofluidic devices; Pressure-driven flows; Sensitivity and specificity; Threedimensional (3-d); Volumetric flow ratio; Flow of fluids",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086632026

For this purpose, ODT is extended in two ways. First, a forcing scheme that maintains statistical stationarity is introduced. Unlike direct numerical simulation (DNS) of forced turbulence, the ODT framework accommodates forcing that is not directly coupled to the momentum equation. For given forcing the ODT energy dissipation rate is therefore the same in particle-laden cases as in the corresponding single-phase reference case. Second, previously implemented one-way-coupled particle phenomenology is extended to two-way coupling using the general ODT methodology for flow modulation through interaction with any specified energy and momentum sources and sinks. As in a DNS comparison case for Reλ=70, turbulence modulation is diagnosed primarily on the basis of the fluid-phase kinetic-energy spectrum. Because ODT involves subprocesses with straightforward physical interpretations, the ODT mechanisms of particle-induced turbulence modulation are clearly identified and they are plausibly relevant to particle-laden Navier-Stokes turbulence. ODT results for the ratio of particle-phase and fluid-phase kinetic energies as a function of particle Stokes number and mass loading are reported for the purpose of testing these predictions in the future when these quantities are evaluated experimentally or using DNS. © 2020 authors.

The present study deals with the seismic responses of bridge-abutment transition backfills (BATBs), which are essential components of HSR bridges. BATBs provide a gradual variation of vertical stiffness between the bridge deck and nominal engineered backfill, enabling smooth operations for trains traveling at high speeds. All prior investigations focused on this vertical stiffness in order to better characterize the localized vertical differential movements around BATBs under periodic high axial loads from train sets. Lateral behavior of BATBs, which would be important under seismic loads, has not previously been investigated. The present study offers a parametric nonlinear lateral force-displacement backbone curve for BATBs that is verified against three-dimensional finite-element models and validated against data from large-scale tests conducted at Brigham Young University.

Currently, improvements in small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) technology can be used to quantify sagebrush morphology and community structure with high resolution imagery on western rangelands, especially in sensitive habitat of the Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). The emergence of photogrammetry algorithms to generate 3D point clouds from true color imagery can potentially increase the efficiency and accuracy of measuring shrub height in sage-grouse habitat. Our objective was to determine optimal parameters for measuring sagebrush height including flight altitude, single-vs. double-pass, and continuous vs. pause features. We acquired imagery using a DJI Mavic Pro 2 multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB camera, flown at 30.5, 45, 75, and 120 m and implementing single-pass and double-pass methods, using continuous flight and paused flight for each photo method. We generated a Digital Surface Model (DSM) from which we derived plant height, and then performed an accuracy assessment using on the ground measurements taken at the time of flight. We found high correlation between field measured heights and estimated heights, with a mean difference of approximately 10 cm (SE = 0.4 cm) and little variability in accuracy between flights with different heights and other parameters after statistical correction using linear regression. We conclude that higher altitude flights using a single-pass method are optimal to measure sagebrush height due to lower requirements in data storage and processing time. © 2020 by the authors.

However, its complete oxidation has been a challenge. Dimethyl viologen, as an electron mediator, has been shown to promote high levels of glucose oxidation under aerobic conditions. Nevertheless, the efficiency of viologen-mediated glucose oxidation has been low in electrochemical experiments. In this study, viologen-mediated oxidation of glucose was investigated under anaerobic electrochemical conditions to understand the factors that impact the oxidation efficiency. Of particular interest was the improvement of electrochemical oxidation for glucose fuel cell applications. An experimental cell was developed to electrochemically reoxidize the mediator as it was homogeneously reduced by glucose under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, the mediator was reoxidized by direct reaction with oxygen under aerobic conditions. The aerobic oxidation efficiency was 75%, three times larger than the maximum efficiency in the electrochemical cell. 13C-NMR results show that the main product formed under aerobic conditions was formic acid, whereas glycolic acid was the principal product formed in the electrochemical cell. Carbonate was only formed under aerobic conditions. Therefore, the use of oxygen to reoxidize the mediator also directly influenced the glucose oxidation pathway. In the electrochemical cell, the oxidation efficiency depended on the electrochemical reaction rate of the mediator and was higher at faster rates. The efficiency also depended on the initial molar ratio of the mediator to glucose. The maximum oxidation efficiency of glucose in the electrochemical cell was approximately 22%, which is about three times larger than the maximum efficiency for precious-metal-based anodes. © 2019","Carbohydrate fuel cell; Glucose fuel cell; Glucose oxidation; Oxidation efficiency; Viologen mediator","Anodes; Electrochemical cells; Fuel cells; Glucose; Molar ratio; Oxygen; Reaction rates; Electrochemical conditions; Electrochemical experiments; Electrochemical reaction rates; Fuel cell application; Glucose fuel cells; Glucose oxidation; Oxidation efficiency; Viologens; Electrochemical oxidation; anoxic conditions; electrochemical method; electrode; experimental study; fuel cell; glucose; oxic conditions; oxidation; reaction rate",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077441269

A new comparator relaxes the stringent speed-noise trade-off under the 0.2-V supply. Employing ac-coupling, stacked input pairs, and voltage-boosted load capacitors, the comparator achieves more than threefold improvement in speed with little noise penalty.

In particular, martensite and other brittle microstructures often form in steels during rotary friction welding (FW). In order to address this, cooling rate and temperature control is developed for FW. Limits of achievable FW cooling rates are primarily determined by thermal and geometric properties such as thermal diffusivity and length. A controller limits interface temperatures during a weld preheat, changing the thermal profile and slowing post-weld cooling. This method is demonstrated in 1045 steel. Cooling simulations, TTT diagrams, microhardness line scans, and scanning electron microscopy are used for analysis. Without temperature and cooling rate control, martensite readily forms after a weld. With temperature and cooling rate control, martensitic transformations are completely avoided and a pearlitic microstructure is developed. Temperature and cooling rate control is a viable tool in designing post-weld microstructures within achievable cooling rate limitations. © 2019","Cooling rate; Friction welding; Microstructure control; Rotary friction welding; Temperature control; Transformation","Friction; Friction welding; Martensite; Martensitic transformations; Microstructure; Pearlite; Pearlitic transformations; Scanning electron microscopy; Temperature control; Welds; Cooling rates; Geometric properties; Interface temperatures; Microstructure control; Pearlitic microstructure; Rotary friction welding; Transformation; Weld microstructures; Cooling",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076626047

Machine vision technology has been a proven solution for inspection and grading of food products since the late 1980s. The remaining challenges, especially for small to midsize facilities, include the system and operating costs, demand for high-skilled workers for complicated configuration and operation and, in some cases, unsatisfactory results. This paper focuses on the development of an embedded solution with learning capability to alleviate these challenges. Three simple application cases are included to demonstrate the operation of this unique solution. Two datasets of more challenging cases were created to analyze and demonstrate the performance of our visual inspection algorithm. One dataset includes infrared images of Medjool dates of four levels of skin delamination for surface quality grading. The other one consists of grayscale images of oysters with varying shape for shape quality evaluation. Our algorithm achieved a grading accuracy of 95.0% on the date dataset and 98.6% on the oyster dataset, both easily surpassed manual grading, which constantly faces the challenges of human fatigue or other distractions.

The unusual inverse piezoresistive behavior of the sensors has been modeled using quantum tunneling and percolation theory. However, the impact of the distribution of conductive particles in the matrix, and specifically their relative orientation, has not been well studied. The initial and deformed distribution of orientations greatly influences the sensor behavior, since the quantum tunneling model is highly sensitive to the polymer gaps between nanoparticles; the evolution of these gaps under deformation is strongly dependent upon the relative orientation of neighboring particles, and determines electron transport properties, and overall sensor response. In this paper a simple analytical model for isotropic orientation distribution and subsequent Poisson-based gap evolution is compared with a more sophisticated finite element and random resistor network analysis. The new numerical model was able to explain previously unexplained physical behavior and is used to design sensors with specific desired characteristics. The appropriateness of the previously assumed percolation behavior is also examined via the model and generalized effective medium theory. © 2020","Finite element analysis (FEA); Nanocomposite; Percolation theory; Piezoresistive sensor","Electron transport properties; Electron tunneling; Finite element method; Inverse problems; Matrix algebra; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Percolation (solid state); Poisson distribution; Polymers; Quantum chemistry; Solvents; Conductive nanoparticles; Effective medium theories; Orientation distributions; Percolation behavior; Percolation theory; Piezo-resistive behavior; Piezo-resistive sensors; Random resistor networks; Wearable sensors",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078191874

An additive manufacturing (AM) method that retains these properties while enabling customized geometry fabrication would provide bone scaffolds for a larger range of geometries while maintaining the benefits of DBM. This work examines laser sintering (LS) of a blend of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and polycaprolactone (PCL) using a CO2 laser beam. A comprehensive experimental study was carried out to find the conditions that form defect-free layers while still retaining the favorable biological features of DBM. The results identify a process setting window over which LS can be utilized to constructing complex patient-specific scaffolds. With the identified setting, first, the DBM/PCL blend was fused in the LS machine. Parts were then were further strengthened through a post-processing heat treatment. The shrinkage level, skeletal density, mechanical testing, and porosimetry of the resultant samples were compared to traditional machined DBM blocks. The maximum tensile strength of the samples and post-processing shrinkage depends on heat treatment duration. The tensile strength measurements demonstrate that the post-processing conditions can be tuned to achieve the tensile strength of the demineralized bone strips. Evaluation of the dimensional change suggests that the shrinkage along the laser paths is ~0.3% while thickness shrinks the most (up to ~20%). The porosimetry and density studies showed that the final part achieved over 40% porosity with a density comparable to blocks of DBM. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The contact phenomenon of CCMs increases the difficulties of their analysis and design, especially when they exhibit beam-to-beam contact. Considering the particularity of CCMs analysis, which is more about the mechanisms’ deformation, this paper presents a numerical method to analyze the large deflection and stress of the CCMs considering beam-to-beam contacts. Based on our previous work on beam-to-rigid contact, the large deformation of general beams in CCMs is modeled by using the chained pseudo-rigid-body model (CPRBM). An approximation based on the geometric information of CPRBM is proposed in this paper to rapidly determine the moving boundary curve for beam-to-beam contact constraints. The static equilibrium configuration of CCMs is solved by minimizing its potential energy function under the geometric constraints from the boundary curves of contacts. A formulation is also provided to evaluate the normal stress along the deformed beam based on the deformation of CPRBM's torsional springs. Numerical examples and finite element analysis are used to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chained pseudo-rigid-body model; Compliant mechanisms; Contact analysis; Large deflection","Compliant mechanisms; Deformation; Mechanisms; Potential energy functions; Rigid structures; Contact analysis; Contact-aided compliant mechanisms; Geometric constraint; Geometric information; Large deflection; Large deflection analysis; Pseudo-rigid body models; Static equilibrium configurations; Numerical methods",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075558830

Biomass ash contents vary substantially among fuel types and are typified by the three fuels compared in this investigation. These fuels have ash-content ratios of about 40:1, which should allow experimental observation of ash effects. In addition, the experiments explore char gasification rates under kinetically controlled conditions that should highlight the effects of ash. By contrast, diffusion controlled burning rates may mask the types of ash effects observed here. The experimental and theoretical results indicate that refractory material such as ash reduces kinetic reaction rates by rendering portions of the surface area inert as char burnout proceeds and ash content increases. Ash also affects particle size in a somewhat compensatory manner. A theoretical model has been developed to quantify the ash effect. This model indicates that all chars from ash-forming fuels should experience similar behavior, which manifests itself as a decrease in the kinetic burning rate in late stages of burnout even though the kinetic reactivity of the char does not change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ash; Biomass; Gasification; Non-catalytic","Ashes; Biomass; Fuels; Gasification; Particle size; Reaction rates; Char gasification; Char reactivity; Diffusion controlled; Kinetic reactions; Kinetic reactivity; Kinetically controlled; Non-catalytic; Theoretical modeling; Kinetics; ash; biomass; burning; catalysis; experimental study; reaction kinetics; reactive transport; theoretical study",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076842269

Experimental bicrystals can be difficult or expensive to fabricate, and computational constraints limit atomistic bicrystal simulations to high-symmetry GBs (i.e., those with small enough GB periodicity). Although the use of bicrystal property data to construct GB structure–property models is more direct, in many experimental situations the only type of data available may be measurements of the effective properties of polycrystals. In this work, we investigate the possibility of inferring GB structure–property models from measurements of the homogenized effective properties of polycrystals when the form of the structure–property model is unknown.

Adaptive methods which restore symmetry to the relay test are developed, and additional methods are presented to detect and recover from a non-oscillation condition. This is demonstrated both in simulation and in a process with significant transients and disturbances — friction stir welding (FSW). In testing, it is shown that the adaptive method is able to restore symmetry even in the presence of severe and changing disturbances, including after the weld plunge where temperature gradients change rapidly. These improvements enable system identification of systems such as FSW in a more robust and accurate manner. © 2019 ISA","Auto tuning; Friction stir welding; Relay feedback test; System identification; Temperature control","Feedback; Friction; Identification (control systems); Relay control systems; Religious buildings; Research laboratories; Restoration; Temperature control; Adaptive methods; Adaptive relay; Autotuning; Friction stir welding(FSW); Non-oscillations; Relay feedback test; Relay test; Friction stir welding; article; simulation; welding",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070753594

One method to enable this adaptivity is to select the most representative model from a set of “pre-aged” models that represent the characteristics of the cell as different cyclic and calendar aging processes occur. By modeling the aging of a cell as a Markovian process, an interacting multiple-model Kalman filter (IMM) can be utilized to determine a time-varying probability mass function that specifies the probability that each of the models under consideration is the best representation of the cell under observation. While the output of the IMM is useful by itself, its predictions can be improved by post-processing. In this paper, we present methods to analyze the time-series probability mass function produced by the IMM using the Viterbi and BCJR algorithms in common use in the digital-communications discipline. These algorithms seek to identify the “best path” through the space of available models over time, based on the likelihoods produced by the IMM and the Markovian transition probabilities. Through the use of these post-processing algorithms, confidence in the best-fitting model can be improved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aged parameter estimation; Battery management systems; BCJR Algorithm; Interacting multiple model Kalman filter; Lithium ion battery; Viterbi algorithm","Battery management systems; Digital communication systems; Functions; Ions; Kalman filters; Probability; Viterbi algorithm; BCJR algorithm; Digital communications; Interacting multiple model; Markovian process; Post processing; Postprocessing algorithms; Probability mass function; Transition probabilities; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074630040

A discrete ordinates method is used to solve the radiative heat transfer equation with radiative properties calculated using a weighted-sum-of-grey-gases (WSGG) model for gases and Mie and Rayleigh theory for particles including fuel, ash and soot. Measurement data gathered from a pilot-scale test furnace, comprising temperature, gas composition and particle concentration, is used in combination with temperature data and operation parameters gathered from a conventional rotary kiln to model a full-scale rotary kiln with a present bed material. The modelled cases have a thermal input of about 37 MWth and in addition to radiative heat transfer, conductive heat transfer within, as well as between, the bed and wall material are included in the model along with convective heat transfer from the gas and heat release from exothermic reactions in the bed. The model also considers the rotational wall and includes a simplified mixing model of the bed material as well as heat losses from the outside wall of the rotary kiln due to radiation and convection. For two different flames, one coal and one oil flame, surface temperatures are calculated on the inside and outside of the rotary kiln and compared to measurements. The model appears to predict the inner wall and bed surface temperatures well with errors less than 11%.

Four large-grained tantalum tensile specimens were strained in uniaxial tension, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data were collected, and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) maps of the four specimens in the unloaded state were produced. EBSD-based GND maps revealed several types of features with high GND content which caused back stress in the specimens. Correlations between five geometrically-based grain boundary (GB) transmission factors and the GB GND content were evaluated, and statistically significant correlations were found for transmission factors based on Livingston and Chalmer's N factor, Werner and Prantl's slip transfer number, and GB misorientation. The sign of individual components of the Nye tensor were used to visually and quantitatively identify clustering of GNDs of the same sign, thus giving additional evidence of increasing back stress due to deformation. Deformation of one of the specimens was simulated using multiple CPFEM based modeling approaches and predicted stress-strain responses are compared. The super dislocation model (SD model) — a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) which incorporates elastic dislocation interactions — was able to isolate impact of back stress on the overall flow stress. The SD model predicted correct stresses when compared with experimental data; however, when the elastic interactions in the SD model were turned off, stress predictions were 25% too low. Thus, demonstrating the importance of incorporating back stress into the model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","back stress; cpfem; ebsd; gnd; tantalum","Grain boundaries; Tantalum; Back stress; cpfem; Crystal plasticity finite element methods (CP FEM); ebsd; Electron back scatter diffraction; Geometrically necessary dislocations; Individual components; Stress-strain response; Deformation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075910989

Results indicate that technological turbulence, green recruitment and selection and green training, involvement and development are positive predictors of green team creativity. Green performance and compensation negatively predict green team creativity. While green team creativity positively predicts green product innovation, environmental dynamic capability negatively predicts green product innovation. Technological turbulence reinforces the positive impact of green recruitment and selection on green team creativity and dampens the positive impact of green training, involvement and development on green team creativity. Furthermore, green team creativity is a complementary and competitive mediator.

The moderately hydrophobic drug latanoprost was rapidly loaded in 4 min by swelling contact lenses in a solution of the drug in n-propanol. A fraction of the drug was radiolabeled, thus allowing measurement of the uptake and subsequent release of drug into artificial tear fluid. Three questions were addressed: (1) how much drug can be loaded into each type of lens, (2) how fast is drug release, and (3) how are these values related to the contact lens chemistry. The results showed that much more latanoprost could be loaded into SiHy lenses than a conventional contact lens of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate). The drug uptake correlated with the amount of swelling in n-propanol, with Galyfilcon lenses having the greatest swelling and highest drug uptake. The drug release from the SiHy lenses occurred over days, whereas the conventional lens released nearly all drug in a burst over a few hours. To examine correlations between lens chemistry, drug chemistry and uptake, and solvent chemistry, the Hansen solubility parameters were calculated using estimates of contact lens chemistry. These results showed that drug uptake in SiHy lenses correlated with favorable solubility parameter interactions between the n-propanol and the lens material, but did not correlate with interactions between the drug and the lens materials. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","drug delivery; latanoprost; Silicone hydrogel contact lens; swelling","Contact lenses; Drug delivery; Hydrogels; Propanol; Silicones; Solubility; Swelling; Targeted drug delivery; Artificial tears; Conventional lens; Hansen solubility parameters; latanoprost; Poly hydroxy ethyl methacrylates; Silicone hydrogels; Solubility parameters; Solvent chemistries; Controlled drug delivery; alpha tocopherol; galyfilcon A; latanoprost; propanol; trichloroethylene; Article; drug release; drug uptake; priority journal; swelling",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073989024

Phase shift is a measure of the rotational translation of a distortion profile and is valuable for understanding the translational motion of distortion as it passes through the fan. At choke and design operating conditions the phase shift is positive in the direction of rotor rotation. At near-stall the phase shift is negative opposite rotor rotation for the outer 30% span. Local power reaches a maximum value, resulting in the generation of a uniform pressure region.

Using equations developed for both convex and crossed cyclic quadrilaterals, the geometry of the reference surface to which a four-bar mechanism can be mapped is found. Grashof mechanisms can be mapped to two surfaces in open or crossed configurations. The only way to map a non-Grashof mechanism to a cylindrical surface is in its open configuration. Extramobile and intramobile behavior can be achieved depending on selected pairs within a cyclic quadrilateral and its position within the circumcircle. Selecting different sets of links as the ground link changes the potential behavior of the mechanism. Different cases are tabulated to represent all possibilities.

The most significant roadblock to industry’s implementation of LCM is the usually higher void content compared with prepreg processing. One tool for reducing void levels in LCM involves optimization of flow velocity, which requires models to be developed to describe void formation at a given velocity. To help solve this problem, the following research illustrates the first known method for optical void measurement in situ during infusion in a carbon fiber reinforcement. Similar to previous studies on glass fiber, this work utilizes fluorescent dye and a digital camera to produce sufficient contrast and resolution for image analysis. Visible bubbles are photographed against the opaque carbon fiber background. An automated method of image analysis is outlined, which was used to analyze 230 images for three different flow orientations of a single fabric, producing the highest amount of experimental data seen so far on in situ void measurement. The resulting data identifies a minimum velocity threshold for minimal macro-void formation. The resultant void characterization framework will better enable optimization of LCM processing for high-performance composites based on carbon reinforcements. © The Author(s) 2020.","bubble; flow optimization; in situ; LCM; Void","Flow velocity; Graphite fibers; Optical data processing; Autoclave methods; Automated methods; Carbon reinforcements; Flow orientations; High performance composites; Liquid composite molding; Minimum velocities; Optical measurement; Image analysis",Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091027375

Over recent years, this has led to the implicit assumption that the quality of such embeddings is determined solely by their ability to facilitate transfer learning. In this position paper we argue that pre-trained linguistic embeddings have value above and beyond their utility as input features for downstream tasks. We adopt a paradigm in which they are instead treated as implicit knowledge repositories that can be used to solve common-sense reasoning problems via linear operations on embedded text. To validate this paradigm, we apply our methodology to tasks such as threat detection, emotional classification, and sentiment analysis, and demonstrate that linguistic embeddings show strong potential at solving such tasks directly, without the need for additional training. Motivated by these results, we advocate for empirical evaluations of language models that include vector-based reasoning tasks in addition to more traditional benchmarks, with the ultimate goal of facilitating language-based reasoning, or ‘reasoning in the linguistic domain’. We conclude by analyzing the structure of currently available embedding models and identifying several shortcomings which must be overcome in order to realize the full potential of this approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Common-sense reasoning; Language model evaluation; Language models; Sentence embeddings; Word embeddings","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Intelligent computing; Sentiment analysis; Transfer learning; Based reasonings; Commonsense reasoning; Emotional classification; Empirical evaluations; Implicit knowledge; Internal representation; Linear operations; Threat detection; Embeddings",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088499748

This improvement can be shown by using a continuous time Markov chain. However, typical Markov chain models do not model common cause failures (CCF), which is a singular event that simultaneously causes failure in multiple redundant modules. This paper introduces a new Markov chain to model CCF in TMR with repair systems. This new model is compared to the idealized models of TMR with repair without CCF. The fundamental limitations that CCF imposes on the system are shown and discussed. In a motivating example, it is seen that CCF imposes a limitation of 51× on the reliability improvement in a system with TMR and repair compared to a simplex system, (i.e., without TMR). A case study is also presented where the likelihood of CCF is reduced by a factor of 18× using various mitigation techniques. Reducing the CCF compounds the reliability improvement of TMR with repair and leads to a overall system reliability improvement of 10,000× compared to the simplex system as supported by the proposed model. © 2020 IEEE.","Common cause failure; Continuous time Markov chains; Systems with repair; Triple modular redundancy (TMR)","Continuous time systems; Fault tolerant computer systems; Maintainability; Markov chains; Repair; Time-to-failure; Common cause failure; Continuous time Markov chain; Fundamental limitations; Markov chain models; Mitigation techniques; Reliability improvement; System reliability; Triple modular redundancy; Redundancy",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090471842

The inflatable joints used in this article consist of a strong fabric exterior that constrains two opposing compliant air bladders that generate torque (unlike McKibben actuators where pressure changes cause translation). This antagonistic structure allows the simultaneous control of position and stiffness. However, dynamic models of soft robots that allow variable stiffness control have not been well developed. In this work, a model that includes stiffness as a state variable is developed and validated. Using the stiffness model, a sliding mode controller and model predictive controller are developed to control stiffness and position simultaneously. For sliding mode control (SMC), the joint stiffness was controlled to within 0.07 Nm/rad of a 45 Nm/rad command. For model predictive control (MPC) the joint stiffness was controlled to within 0.045 Nm/rad of the same stiffness command. Both SMC and MPC were able to control to within 0.5° of a desired position at steady state. Stiffness control was extended to a multiple-degree-of-freedom soft robot using MPC. Controlling stiffness of a 4-DOF arm reduced the end-effector deflection by approximately 50% (from 17.9 to 12.2cm) with a 4 lb (1.8 kg) step input applied at the end effector when higher joint stiffness (40 Nm/rad) was used compared with low stiffness (30 Nm/rad).

This paper studies the design and analysis of such arrays for scalability, including the performance metrics of specific power, power density, stiffness, and strength. Key advantages of the architecture are the trends of performance metrics which indicate increased performance with increased array power. The limiting constraint is found to be the stowed height dimension and another candidate folding pattern is discussed that eliminates the height constraint violation. Strengths and weaknesses of the architecture are discussed. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This work presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new array architecture that is self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR) and is described in this work. To understand the behavior of such systems, this work presents the modeling and testing of an SDSR array using an origami flasher pattern and discusses the results for the performance considerations of deployment motion, deployment stiffness, and dynamics. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Permitted phasing allows vehicles to turn left after yielding to opposing vehicles; protected phasing provides an exclusive phase for vehicles to turn left without opposition; and protected-permitted phasing combines these phasing alternatives, allowing both permitted and protected turning movements. Intersections with 1, 2, and 3 opposing-lane configurations with permitted and protected-permitted models (split into green times of 10, 15, and 20 s) were analyzed for a total of 12 simulation models. Each model was divided into 100–225 different volume scenarios, with incremental increases in left-turn and opposing volumes. By exporting trajectory files from VISSIM and importing these into the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model, crossing conflicts for each volume combination in each model were extracted. MATLAB was then used to create contour maps representing the number of crossing conflicts per hour associated with different combinations of left-turn and opposing volume. Basic decision boundaries were examined in each contour map. Statistical analysis software was used to perform a linear regression analysis on transformed data and to develop natural log-based equations that form the decision boundaries for each configuration and phase alternative. These equations were graphed and final decision boundaries developed for the 1-, 2-, and 3-lane configurations between permitted and protected-permitted phasing as well as between protected-permitted and protected phasing. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"MATLAB; Regression analysis; Vehicles; Contour map; Decision boundary; Final decision; Left turns; Safety assessments; Signalized intersection; Traffic volumes; Intersections",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087745898

Concurrent advancements in computational power, continuum theory, and experimental diagnostics are enabling unprecedented understanding of such interactions. However, we cannot develop a sufficient level of confidence in such mesoscale capability until the constitutive description of the underlying constituents is reliably representative of their actual physical behavior. Therefore, there is a strong need to combine experimental, modeling, and data-science techniques to validate models of the thermomechanical response of individual single crystals. One experimental diagnostic with high potential impact to shock physics and materials science is in-situ x-ray diffraction. This paper is primarily focused on simulation of x-ray diffraction in shock physics, but with an aim toward quantifying parametric uncertainty of simulation models. We develop and demonstrate a data-science and model-driven approach to constrain the parameterization of continuum models of crystal lattice deformation associated with the shock response of crystalline materials. The framework is built around the connection between continuum hydrodynamic simulations of lattice deformation and a new Bragg diffraction simulation code, BarberShop. The dynamic deformation of a crystal lattice is modeled using the DiscoFlux model within an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian hydrodynamic code, FLAG. These detailed continuum simulations of lattice deformation can be computationally slow, thus a statistical model is used to emulate the evolution of lattice deformation fields in time and across the considered model parameter space. Emulated lattice deformation fields can then be generated rapidly for any combination of physics model parameters. In turn, these fields can be fed into BarberShop to realize a rapid prediction of Bragg diffraction patterns associated with particular values of physics model parameters. The framework enables parameterization of the single crystal model to obtain Bragg diffraction patterns that most closely resemble a corresponding measurement. Furthermore, the framework naturally provides sensitivities of the lattice deformation to the physics parameters. We highlight the utility of this framework through the application to a synthetic closed-loop inverse problem leading to the parameterization of a single crystal material model. As a model problem, we consider the dynamic response of the energetic molecular crystal, cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (or RDX), under dynamic compression induced by simulated flyer plate impact experiments. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Bragg diffraction; Lattice deformation; Machine learning; Shock physics; Single crystal model; X-ray","Bragg cells; Codes (symbols); Computation theory; Continuum mechanics; Crystal lattices; Crystallites; Data Science; Deformation; Diffraction patterns; Hydrodynamics; Interferometry; Molecular crystals; Nanocrystalline materials; Parameterization; Single crystals; X ray diffraction; Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian; Crystal lattice deformation; Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine; Dynamic compression experiment; In-situ X-ray diffraction; Parametric uncertainties; Single-crystal materials; Thermo-mechanical response; Inverse problems",Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088291766

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer an attractive alternative to supporting and defending various threats at borders. This paper applies a differential game to define a border defense scenario where one UAV (pursuer) seeks to capture two intruders (evaders) before they reach a designated border. The evaders can be UAVs, marine or ground vehicles, or human agents, but they have a lower maximum speed than the pursuer throughout the game. Simple motion is assumed for the pursuer and evaders with complete state information shared across all agents. The game is played within a rectangular area with a parallel top and bottom border of length L and left and right borders with a length of W, for a game aspect ratio of L∕W. The value of the game is the minimum distance to the bottom border achieved by the evaders at any time before capture of both evaders. Within the region where the pursuer wins, the game of degree is explored and the optimal policy for both the evaders and pursuer is derived using geometric properties. © 2020 by John Salmon.

Understanding the wetting effects due to ultrasonic vibration could provide a means for changing the behavior of liquids on any surface. In previous studies, low-frequency surface vibrations have been used to alter wetting states of droplets by exciting droplet volume modes. While high-frequency (>20 kHz) surface vibration can also cause droplets to wet or spread on a surface, this effect is relatively uncharacterized. In this study, droplets of various liquids with volumes ranging from 2 to 70 μL were vibrated on hydrophobic-coated (FluoroSyl) glass substrates fixed to a piezoelectric transducer at varying amplitudes and at a range of frequencies between 21 and 42 kHz. The conditions for contact line motion were evaluated, and the change in droplet diameter under vibration was measured. Droplets of all tested liquids initially begin to spread out at a similar surface acceleration level. The results show that the increase in diameter is proportional to the maximum acceleration of the surface. Finally, liquid properties and surface roughness may also produce some secondary effects, but droplet volume and excitation frequency do not significantly change the droplet spreading behavior within the parameter range studied. © 2020 by the authors.","Accelerometer; Contact angle; Contact line; Spreading; Ultrasonic vibration; Wetting",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081268725

The nonlinear parameter extracted in NRUS is based on the dependence of the resonance frequency on vibration amplitude in the presence of damage. NRUS measurements typically are excited with a piezoelectric transducer, but here the application of an electromagnetic transducer is explored as an alternative. The electromagnetic transducer, unlike a single piezoelectric, allows selective excitation of longitudinal, torsional, and bending vibrations in a rod-shaped sample. Measurement of the nonlinear properties of the sample for each type of vibration is therefore possible. This electromagnetic technique involves gluing a coil of wire onto the end of a rod sample and placing it in a magnetic field. By controlling which part of the coil is inside the strongest region of the magnetic field, the principal direction of the driven oscillations in the rod can be controlled.

The proposed device may be useful for applications requiring a revolute joint that behaves differently when deflecting clockwise/anti-clockwise. The presence of the contact pair reduces the free length of one flexures, resulting in a considerable increment of the overall joint stiffness. The pivot behaviour is investigated, for different load cases, via the Chained-Beam-Constraint Model (CBCM), namely an accurate method to be applied in large deflection problems. A framework comprising Matlab and ANSYS is developed for testing the CAFP performances in terms of rotational stiffness, parasitic shift and maximum stress, with different combinations of geometrical aspect ratios and contact extensions. Results achieved via CBCM for a pure rotation applied to the CAFP's output link are then verified through Finite Element Analysis. The resulting performance maps show good agreement between the numerical results. Furthermore, the CBCM shows an improved computational efficiency, which is a crucial aspect for preliminary design steps. At last, direct comparison between simulations and experiments, developed by means of two custom test rigs, confirms the efficacy of the proposed design method for the modeling of contacts in large deflection problems. © 2019","Chained-beam-constraint model; Contact-aided compliant mechanism; Cross-Axis Flexural Pivot; Multi software framework","Aspect ratio; Computational efficiency; Computer programming; Mechanisms; Stiffness; Constraint model; Contact-aided compliant mechanisms; Cross-Axis Flexural Pivot; Geometrical aspects; Numerical results; Preliminary design; Rotational stiffness; Software frameworks; MATLAB",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074275437

This real-time high-fidelity model approximates the results of offline high-fidelity models without requiring operation by model experts.

However, recent modifications to large eddy-simulation (LES) methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high-temperature ratio in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly heated laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer as well as along the nozzle lip line shows evidence of distinct noise production mechanisms that transfer information differently from the flow to the field. A phenomenological comparison between the LES and measurements of an afterburning F-35 aircraft is then made. Although the LES is not run at the exact same conditions as the aircraft and does not reproduce all of the phenomena present in the aircraft’s jet noise field, differences between noise production mechanisms observed in the LES may describe some of the spatiospectral lobe phenomena observed in the measurements of the F-35. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Although these enhancements appeared to be successful at improving safety, there was a need to evaluate their effectiveness. This research evaluates the safety impacts of several pedestrian crossing enhancements using Utah-specific compliance rates of drivers as a surrogate safety measure. This study analyzes enhanced pedestrian crossings to determine the factors that affect the compliance of driver yielding in Utah and provides a statistical analysis to prove the significance of each factor on compliance. The results show that the “High-intensity Activated crossWalK” (HAWK) is more effective at reducing the probability of a non-compliant event compared with an overhead flashing beacon (OFB), and that an OFB is more effective at reducing the probability of a non-compliant event compared with a rectangular rapid flashing beacon (RRFB) or an overhead rectangular rapid flashing beacon (ORRFB). The results show that adding a pedestrian enhancement to a marked crosswalk at a location with five lanes and speed limit between 35 mph and 45 mph can increase compliance rate by 97% for the HAWK, 77% for the OFB, and 57% for the RRFB and ORRFB. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Crosswalks; Footbridges; Traffic signals; Fatality rates; High intensity; Safety impact; Safety measures; Speed limit; Technological enhancement; Utah department of transportations; Pedestrian safety",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087742063

Often these analogies require approximations, but in the limit of large radii where TCF becomes rotating plane Couette flow (RPC) exact relations can be established. When the flows are restricted to two spatial independent variables, there is an exact specification that maps the three velocity components in RPC to the two velocity components and one temperature field in RBC. Using this, we deduce several relations between both flows: (i) heat and angular momentum transport differ by, explaining why angular momentum transport is not symmetric around even though the relation between, the Rayleigh number, and, a non-dimensional measure of the rotation, has this symmetry. This relationship leads to a predicted value of that maximizes the angular momentum transport that agrees remarkably well with existing numerical simulations of the full three-dimensional system. (ii) One variable in both flows satisfies a maximum principle, i.e. the fields' extrema occur at the walls. Accordingly, backflow events in shear flow cannot occur in this quasi two-dimensional setting. (iii) For free-slip boundary conditions on the axial and radial velocity components, previous rigorous analysis for RBC implies that the azimuthal momentum transport in RPC is bounded from above by, where is the shear Reynolds number, with a scaling exponent smaller than the anticipated. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

The method uses a multilevel framework called relative navigation and visual-inertial odometry: Both of which have been used for singlevehicle GPS-denied navigation. This work modifies the relative navigation architecture by adding the necessary elements to enable decentralized, cooperative operations. The proposed framework also includes the ability to incorporate intervehicle measurements and uses a new concept called the coordinated reset, which is necessary for optimizing the cooperative odometry and improving localization. A simple communication protocol is presented, as well as flight-test results that show its effectiveness. The method is first demonstrated in simulation, including Monte Carlo testing, to show the expected improvement gained from cooperation. Finally, results from hardware testing are presented that show the ability of the system to reject initialization errors, to operate with temporary communications dropouts, and to greatly reduce the total amount of shared data compared to a naive approach.

To address these challenges, a variety of techniques have been reported in a growing stream of publications. This paper surveys and compares the conceptual ideas, key advances, and applicable scopes, and open problems of the state-of-the-art kinetostatic and dynamic modeling methods for compliant mechanisms in terms of small and large deflections.

Human supervision and remote robot control are often required to operate robots in unpredictable and changing scenarios. Often, robots are controlled remotely by technicians via joystick interfaces which require training and experience to operate. To improve robot usage and practicality, we propose using augmented reality (AR) to create a more intuitive, less training-intensive means of controlling robots than traditional joystick control. AR is a creative platform for developing robot control systems, because AR combines the real world (the environment around the user, the physical robot, etc.) with the digital world (holograms, digital displays, etc.); it can even interpret physical gestures, such as pinching two fingers. In this research, a Microsoft Hololens headset is used to create an AR environment to control a Yaskawa Motoman SIA5D robot. The control process begins with the user placing an interactable holographic robot in 3D space. The user can then select between two control methods: manual control and automatic control. In manual control, the user can move the end effector of the holographic robot and the physical robot will respond immediately. In automatic control, the user can move the end effector of the holographic robot to a desired location, view a holographic preview of the motion, and select execute if the motion plan is satisfactory. In this preview mode, the user is able to preview both the motion of the robot and the torques experienced by the joints of the manipulator. This gives the user additional feedback on the planned motion. In this project we succeeded in creating an AR control system that makes controlling a robotic manipulator intuitive and effective. © 2020, Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.","Augmented reality; Force feedback; Microsoft Hololens; Motion planning; Robotic arm","Augmented reality; Dynamics; End effectors; Feedback; Holograms; Holographic displays; Man machine systems; Manipulators; Manual control; Motion planning; Process control; Robotic arms; Robotics; Structural dynamics; Complex operations; Force feedback; Human supervision; Interactive robot; Joy-stick interfaces; MicroSoft; Robot control systems; Robotic manipulators; Robot programming",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068112332

Acoustic source identification techniques’ have been used for remote structural health monitoring, but the applicability of each technique has been limited by factors ranging from achievable spatial resolution to hardware costs. This paper aims to mitigate current acoustic techniques’ limitations by exploring the possibility of fusing acoustic and video data. This paper focuses on combining microphone acoustic measurements with vibrational information recovered from video-based measurements. Among acoustic methods, acoustic arrays have been used for remotely detecting, localizing and characterizing acoustic sources. Acoustic-array based techniques are limited in their ability to discriminate multiple closely-spaced acoustic sources from far-field acoustic pressure signals. On the contrary, video-based techniques have shown the ability to recover full-field, high resolution mode shapes, and the associated frequencies and damping ratios with virtually no dependence with the distance from the target. The challenge with video methods, applied to acoustic source identification, is that acoustic sources may occur in the kilohertz range requiring a higher frame per second sampling rate than most low cost cameras. Acoustic measurements provide additional information content that is used to recover the correct frequency content of an acoustically radiating structure from temporally-aliased (sub-Nyquist) video measurements. Experiments are conducted to show how combining acoustic and video data relaxes the hardware requirements for acoustic source detection and localization applications. © 2020, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.","Signal aliasing; Structural health monitoring; Sub-Nyquist sampling; Vibro-acoustics; Video processing","Acoustic arrays; Acoustic measuring instruments; Acoustic noise measurement; Costs; Data fusion; Machinery; Recovery; Structural dynamics; Video recording; Acoustic measurements; Acoustic techniques; Frequency contents; Information contents; Safety and securities; Spatial resolution; Structural health; Vibrational information; Structural health monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092216153

In this paper, we propose a charge unifiable (QU) control scheme that enables a battery charger to improve power efficiency in a low-profile hardware manner. This scheme features fully soft-switching (vis-&#x00E0;-vis hard switching) and single control scheme (vis-&#x00E0;-vis multiple) for distinct constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) charging modes. To the best of authors' knowledge, the proposed QU control scheme is the first to simultaneously offer fully soft-switching, innate CC-and-CV regulation, and seamless CC-to-CV transition. To verify the proposed design, we monolithically realize a low-profile high-efficiency fast battery charger based on this scheme. The prototype embodying a tiny 470-nH output inductor supports a maximum input voltage of 16V, output voltage of 2.2-4.2 V, output current of 0.1-2 A, and peak power efficiency of 96.2&#x0025;. When benchmarked against state-of-the-art counterparts, the proposed charger features at least 2.1x smaller inductor and 7.2&#x0025; higher power efficiency at both the maximum and the minimum output power charging scenarios. Further, this charger is the only design that features &#x2265; 91&#x0025; power efficiency in the whole load range.

By structuring the container of a thermal vapor with narrow emission apertures, the velocity distribution can be modified to create a directed beam of atoms.1 These atomic beams can then interact sequentially with a series of optical fields, or interaction zones, and ultimately allow precision control over the internal state of the atom. This is useful for optical frequency standards and precision spectroscopy2, 3 and may also provide the means to build a simple flying qubit platform.4 Furthermore, atomic beams on a chip can be used as a compact, directed source to load magneto-optical traps (MOTs) while minimally increasing the ambient pressure.5 We apply microfabrication techniques to microscopically structure silicon to deterministically control the ow of Rb between connected cavities. We describe a methodology to measure the experimental parameters that govern the flux of atomic vapors in these microfabricated structures with a goal of creating an equivalent electrical circuit model. This toolkit will provide a simple platform for the creation of atomic beams on a chip with controllable pressure profiles and a thorough understanding of the influence of adsorptive effects and pseudo- ballistic trajectories on the resultant atomic beam. © 2020 SPIE.","atomic beams; atomic physics; atomic sensors; microfabricated vapor cells; optical frequency standards; quantum metrology","Atomic beams; Atoms; Frequency standards; Microfabrication; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Ballistic trajectories; Equivalent electrical circuit model; Experimental parameters; Magnetooptical traps; Micro-fabrication techniques; Optical frequency standard; Precision metrology; Precision spectroscopy; Crystal atomic structure",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083036700

In regions of high residual weld stresses, this may lead to localized stress-corrosion cracking (SCC). The ability to detect and image SCC at an early stage (long before the cracks are susceptible to propagate through the thickness of the canister wall and leaks of radioactive material may occur) is essential to the performance evaluation and licensing process of the storage systems. In this paper, we explore a number of nondestructive testing techniques to detect and image SCC in austenitic stainless steel. Our attention is focused on a small rectangular sample of 1 × 2 in2 with two cracks of mm-scale sizes. The techniques explored in this paper include nonlinear resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (NRUS) for detection, Linear Elastodynamic Gradient Imaging Technique (LEGIT), ultrasonic C-scan, vibrothermography, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction for imaging. Results obtained from these techniques are compared.

No fatalities were reported, but the earthquake caused widespread power outages, structural damage to residential buildings, damage to roadways and railways, and ground failures. This paper presents a summary of preliminary findings by the NSF-sponsored Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) team. Damage was characterized using a combination of on-ground site mapping and aerial reconnaissance with state-of-art geomatics technology and photogrammetry. Recorded peak ground accelerations (PGA) at most stations range between 0.2 g and 0.3 g, with a few sites in the central and southeastern vicinities of Anchorage with PGA greater than 0.5 g. The duration of strong shaking from the M 7.1 event may not have been enough to initiate substantial movements on the majority of the historic landslides from the 1964 M 9.2 earthquake, including the slides at the Turnagain Heights and 4th Avenue. However, liquefaction appeared to have contributed to re-mobilization of the 1964 Potter Hill (Rabbit Creek) landslide. While the majority of the damage observed in Anchorage and surrounding communities appeared to be non-structural, the isolated cases of structural damage seemed to be caused by geotechnical issues, particularly settlement of the foundation and/or slope deformations. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Anchorages (foundations); Antennas; Earthquake engineering; Geotechnical engineering; Landslides; Outages; Structural analysis; Aerial reconnaissance; Alaska earthquakes; Moment magnitudes; Northridge earthquakes; Peak ground acceleration; Residential building; Slope deformation; Structural damages; Earthquakes",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081948655

Workarounds in response to operational failures enable care to continue and therefore may be indicative of workers' commitment. On the other hand, workarounds in the absence of operational failures may signal an ineffective approach associated with lower quality of care and worse patient outcomes. Working closely with healthcare providers, we developed a survey to measure workaround behaviors and operational failures on medical/surgical units. The lead author surveyed over 4,000 nurses from 63 hospitals throughout the United States. We matched this data with audit data on the incidence of pressure injuries among over 21,000 patients on 262 nursing units in 56 survey hospitals. Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are a significant risk to patient health and hospital costs. We do not find support for our hypothesis that workarounds are associated with a higher rate of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. However, when we take into account the moderating role of operational failures on the relationship between workarounds and pressure injuries, we find significant results. When nursing units have lower levels of operational failures, workarounds are associated with higher rates of hospital-acquired pressure injuries.

However, preparation of the most complex CFPS reagent – the cell extract – remains time-consuming and labor-intensive because of the relatively slow growth kinetics of the endotoxin-free ClearColiTMBL21(DE3) strain. Here we report a streamlined procedure for preparing E. coli cell extract from ClearColi™ using auto-induction media. In this work, the term auto-induction describes cell culture media which eliminates the need for manual induction of protein expression. Culturing Clearcoli™ cells in autoinduction media significantly reduces the hands-on time required during extract preparation, and the resulting “endotoxin-free” cell extract maintained the same cell-free protein synthesis capability as extract produced with traditional induction as demonstrated by the high-yield expression of crisantaspase, an FDA approved leukemia therapeutic. It is anticipated that this work will lower the barrier for researchers to enter the field and use this technology as the method to produce endotoxin-free E. coli-based extract for CFPS. © 2019","Auto-induction; Autoinduction; Cell-free protein synthesis; CFPS; Clearcoli; Crisantaspase; Endotoxin-free","asparaginase; cell extract; clearcoli cell extract; unclassified drug; Article; bacterium culture; cell free system; drug approval; Escherichia coli; extraction; Food and Drug Administration; leukemia; nonhuman; protein expression; protein synthesis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076404135

Inlet flow recirculation or backflow in the inducer occurs at low flow conditions and can lead to instabilities and cavitation-induced head breakdown. Backflow of an inducer with a tip clearance (TC) of τ = 0.32% and with no tip clearance (NTC) is examined with a series of computational fluid dynamics simulations. Removing the TC eliminates tip leakage flow; however, backflow is still observed. In fact, the NTC case showed a 37% increase in the length of the upstream backflow penetration. Tip leakage flow does instigate a smaller secondary leading edge tip vortex that is separate from the much larger backflow structure. A comprehensive analysis of these simulations suggests that blade inlet diffusion, not tip leakage flow, is the fundamental mechanism leading to the formation of backflow. © 2019 by ASME.",,"Computational fluid dynamics; Vortex flow; Backflow structure; Comprehensive analysis; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Flow recirculation; Fundamental mechanisms; Low flow condition; Tip clearance; Tip leakage flow; Cavitation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067633048

This modification reduces the relevancy of external metrics as a predictor of performance on unlabeled data, where it is not possible to identify noise points. We propose a modification of standard external metrics to explicitly handle noise points in experimental data. We illustrate the effect of this explicit treatment of noise on clustering evaluation using several examples of common noisy clustering problems as well as a real data set from mass spectrometry.

Experimental results are presented for quasi-static loading in combination with high-resolution tomographic imaging and statistical analysis (homology of pores or voids and induced cracks). Three distinct mechanisms were observed to control delamination growth in the presence of sharp and blunt voids. Delamination cracks interact with the supporting yarns, especially in combination with air pockets trapped in the resin in the form of long, sharp voids. This resulted in crack growth that coalesces with delamination cracks from neighbouring yarn-voids during increased out-of-plane load–displacement, with almost no presence of intralaminar transverse cracks. This highlights the benefits and drawbacks of the supporting yarn during out-of-plane loading. © The Author(s) 2019.","CT analysis; damage mechanics; porosity; Resin transfer moulding","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Computerized tomography; Cracks; Polymers; Porosity; Reinforcement; Resin transfer molding; Resins; Wool; Yarn; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Damage mechanics; Delamination growth; Out-of-plane loading; Quasi-static indentation; Quasi-static loading; Reinforced polymers; Tomographic imaging; Loading",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068251737

By altering the separation between adjacent symbols, the minimum required SNR is raised without degradation in the performance of the scheme. This allows the system to adapt to preferable channel conditions for the authorized user, making it harder for eavesdroppers to intercept and decode the transmission, thus making the communication safer. In addition, we show that by overlaying a coset code onto the QAM constellation, a new, stronger security gap metric can be further improved.

Often, ground-truth video of the activity is recorded along with sensor-data recorded during the activity. The data must be synchronized with the recorded video to be useful. In this paper, we present and compare two labeling frameworks that each has a different approach to synchronization. Approach A uses time-stamped visual indicators positioned on the data loggers. The approach results in accurate synchronization between video and data but adds more overhead and is not practical when using multiple sensors, subjects, and cameras simultaneously. Also, synchronization needs to be redone for each recording session. Approach B uses Real-Time Clocks (RTCs) on the devices for synchronization, which is less accurate but has several advantages: multiple subjects can be recorded on various cameras, it becomes easier to collect more data, and synchronization only needs to be done once across multiple recording sessions. Therefore, it is easier to collect more data which increases the probability of capturing an unusual activity. The best way forward is likely a combination of both approaches. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Annotating; Camera; IMU; Labeling; Synchronization; Video","Cameras; Labeling; Synchronization; Activity recognition; Annotating; Labor intensive; Multiple recordings; Multiple sensors; Video; Video and datum; Visual indicators; Data acquisition",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073520967

Static radiative heat exchangers are often simple and reliable systems but typically cannot be adapted to environmental changes. Adaptable radiative heat exchangers can be adjusted in response to variations in the thermal environment or operating conditions and have the potential for increased efficiency and reduced cost. Dynamic control of a radiative heat exchanger is possible through geometric manipulation of a segmented, self-irradiating fin, consisting of rigid panels that are linked by thermal hinges in an accordion arrangement. In this paper, a numerical model is described to predict the temperature profile and efficiency of a radiative heat exchanger, accounting for conduction and self-irradiation. Governing equations are cast in terms of the conduction-radiation interaction parameter, surface emissivity, actuation angle, and the thermal conductance of the hinges linking the panels. Results indicate that a turn-down ratio (largest possible heat rate divided by smallest possible heat rate) of greater than three is possible for realistic panel geometries and materials. Self-irradiation decreases the turn-down ratio, and there is evidence that an optimal number of rigid panels exists for any combination of panel geometry and device temperature. The maximum efficiency occurs when the plates are in the collapsed position, but the heat rate is at a minimum in this configuration. Finally, the properties and geometry of the plates are shown to have a more significant effect on the turn-down ratio than the properties of the thermal hinges. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Efficiency; Geometry; Heat transfer; Hinges; Irradiation; Temperature control; Conduction radiations; Design and optimization; Environmental change; Geometric manipulation; Temperature profiles; Thermal conductance; Thermal control systems; Thermal environment; Heat exchangers",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070066445

The proposed evolutionary learning algorithm constructs image features as a series of image transforms for image classification and is suitable for resource-limited systems. This algorithm requires only a small number of images and time for training. It does not depend on handcrafted features or manual tuning of parameters and is generalized to be versatile for visual inspection applications. This allows the system to be configured on the fly for different applications and by an operator without extensive experience. An embedded vision system, equipped with an ARM processor running Linux, is capable of performing at roughly one hundred 640 × 480 frames per second which is more than adequate for real-time visual inspection applications. As example applications, three image datasets were created to test the performance of this algorithm. The first dataset was used to demonstrate the suitability of the algorithm for visual inspection automation applications. This experiment combined two applications to make it a more challenging test. One application was for separating fertilized and unfertilized eggs. The other one was for detecting two common defects on the eggshell. Two other datasets were created for road condition classification and pavement quality evaluation. The proposed algorithm was 100% for fertilized egg detection and 98.6% for eggshell quality inspection for a combined 99.1% accuracy. It had an accuracy of 92% for the road condition classification and 100% for pavement quality evaluation. © 2019 by the authors.

However, most existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods mainly focused on a single type of distortions. In this paper, we proposed a no-reference (NR) IQA method for images with multiple distortions. Image distortions not only destroy the intensity of low-level image features, but also alter their distribution, to both of which the human vision system (HVS) is sensitive. Based on these observations, low-level features are represented by phase congruency (PC) which is consistent with human perception. The distribution of low-level features is extracted using local binary pattern (LBP) in PC domain at multiple scales, which can effectively characterize the impact of multiple distortions on images. Given that PC is contrast invariant while the contrast does affect perceptual image quality of the HVS, image gradient magnitude (GM) is employed as a weighting factor for LBP histogram creation. Finally a support vector regression model is trained to map the gradient-weighted LBP histograms in PC domain at multi-scale to quality scores. Experimental results on two benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high consistency with subjective perception and performs better than other state-of-the-art full-reference (FF) and NR IQA methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Image gradient; Image quality assessment; Local binary pattern; No-reference; Phase congruency","Graphic methods; Image communication systems; Regression analysis; Scales (weighing instruments); Image gradients; Image quality assessment; Local binary patterns; No references; Phase congruency; Image quality",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071883973

Various annealing times, temperatures, and cooling rates were evaluated and data collected for over 1000 samples. It was determined that annealing temperature plays the largest role in crease response. An increase in the crystallinity of a PET sheet while in the folded state likely increases the force response of the crease in PET sheets.

Indeed, the way that control is shared between the human operator and the inherent collective robot behaviors determines in large part the success of the human-swarm system. In this paper, we seek to understand how to design human-swarm systems that effectively moderate human influence over a robot swarm. To do this, we implement a simulated swarm system based on honeybees, and study how interacting with this swarm using various methods of moderating human influence impacts the success of the resulting human-swarm system. Our results demonstrate that moderating human influence is essential to achieving effective human-swarm systems, and highlight the need for future work in determining how to better moderate human influence in human-swarm systems. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Machine design; Robots; Collective robots; Human influences; Human operator; Large parts; Operator influence; Robot swarms; Swarm behavior; Swarm systems; Swarm intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076782163

Data race freedom is a desirable property for task parallel programs but is difficult to prove because every possible execution of the program must be considered. A partial order over events of an observed program execution induces an equivalence class of executions that the program may also produce. The Does-not-Commute (DC) relation is an efficiently computable partial order used for data race detection. As a relatively weak partial order, the DC relation can represent relatively large equivalence classes of program executions. However, some of these executions may be infeasible, thus leading to false data race reports. The contribution of this paper is a mechanized proof that the DC relation is actually sound for commonly used task parallel programming models. Sound means that the first data race identified by the DC relation is guaranteed to be a real data race. A prototype analysis in the Java Pathfinder model checker shows that the DC relation can significantly reduce the number of explored states required to prove data race freedom in Habanero Java programs. In this application, the search for data race using the DC relation is both sound and complete. © 2019 FMCAD Inc.",,"Computer aided design; Computer software; Equivalence classes; Formal methods; Model checking; Parallel programming; Data race detection; Java PathFinder; Mechanized proofs; Model checker; Parallel program; Program execution; Sound and complete; Task parallel; Java programming language",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075606362

Industry professionals should focus on practices that can improve project team selection, team building, and identifying challenges to the team and project, hence improving alignment. This paper provides a summary of key findings of a national study of transportation projects, identifying current practices of industry professionals for the selection and alignment of project teams for transportation projects. Current team selection practices, the most beneficial team alignment practices, and the greatest challenges to team alignment are identified in the study. These practices are also analyzed and reported by project delivery method, and the results presented in this paper add to the body of knowledge by identifying current alignment practices, successful practices, and challenges specific to each delivery method. Among the findings are that overall project teams are selected primarily based on project experience and ability to meet schedule, regardless of the project delivery method chosen. Successful teams with good alignment were found to be characterized by having established expectations, team trust, honesty within the team, shared values, and good communication. No notable differences were found among delivery methods, demonstrating that the principles of team alignment are not dependent on the project delivery method. Challenges that cause adversarial relationships in the team include issues of constructability, schedule availability, and project complexity. The study also identified transportation-specific alignment challenges such as public involvement. The greatest challenges specific to each delivery method include team coordination for construction manager at risk (CMAR) projects, constructability procedures for design-bid-build projects, and environmental impacts for design-build projects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Alignment; Environmental impact; Human resource management; Construction manager; Design-build projects; Industry professionals; Project complexity; Project delivery method; Project experiences; Public involvement; Transportation projects; Project management",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071327423

Representative algorithms from the three broad classes of sparse estimators were examined side by side using computer simulations to estimate the postequalizer bit error rate (BER). Ideal and nonideal frequency offset synchronization were assumed in the simulations. The results show that the performance of the matching pursuit (MP) algorithms seemed to be better suited to this application in the sense that no additional steps were required and the postequalizer BER of the best MP algorithm was slightly better than that of the other sparse estimation techniques. In the case of both ideal and nonideal frequency offset synchronization, the postequalizer BER achieved by the generalized orthogonal MP algorithm was approximately 1.5 dB better than that obtained using the nonsparse-constrained maximum likelihood channel estimate. © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Continuous phase modulation (CPM); equalization; frequency selective multipath; shaped offset QPSK (SOQPSK); sparse channel estimation","Bit error rate; Equalizers; Frequency allocation; Frequency estimation; Maximum likelihood estimation; Quadrature phase shift keying; Telemetering; Telemetering equipment; Continuous phase modulation; equalization; Frequency selective multipath; Matching pursuit algorithms; SOQPSK; Sparse channel estimations; Channel estimation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059462341

While CI-CNTs are only roughly conductive they work well in micro springs, levers, and meshes. However, fabrication of CI-CNTs can result in large mechanical property variation, and methods to characterize properties usually involve destructive testing. Destructive testing also assumes the tested specimens are representative of the entire batch which is not always true in the case of CI-CNT production. Finding a non-destructive way to test for stiffness of this material reduces the number of parts that have to be made and increases confidence in the integrity of device being used. It also simplifies testing of complex parts. The stiffness of CI-CNT beams is related to the molecular structure of the carbon material infiltrated between the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), how it interacts with the CNTs, and how much of it there is. The amount of material can be approximated with the density of the beam, and both the type of material and its interaction with the CNTs can be approximated through analysis of the Raman spectra taken at the surface. A combination of these two observations can be related to the effective material stiffness. The relationship can be fitted with a power function, with a variance of 1.41 GPa, which is about 11% of the maximum stiffness of the samples tested. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","bending modulus; carbon infiltrated-carbon nanotubes; carbon nanotubes; density; non-destructive testing; Raman spectroscopy","Bridge decks; Density (specific gravity); MEMS; Nondestructive examination; Raman spectroscopy; Stiffness; Bending moduli; Carbon material; Destructive testing; Effective materials; Emerging materials; Maximum stiffness; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Non destructive testing; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076055056

However, there were some open circuits, increases in resistance, and delamination when LAPS Nylon devices were subjected to extreme temperatures and 20 000 G shock loading normal to the substrate. The thermal effects are likely due to the thermal expansion mismatch between Nylon and the conductive paste while the mechanical shock effects may be attributed to the geometry differences of the LAPS Nylon printed packaging. Further studies are required to understand these failure modes in some of the LAPS Nylon samples and refine the process to address them. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","additive manufacturing; conductive ink; electronic packaging9large area projection sintering; harsh environmental testing; hybrid electronics; printed electronics","3D printers; Cylinders (shapes); Electron devices; Environmental technology; Environmental testing; Failure (mechanical); Polyamides; Rayon; Sintering; Thermal expansion; Thermal shock; Area projection; Conductive ink; Environmental conditions; Extreme temperatures; Printed electronics; Strength failures; Temperature cycling; Thermal expansion mismatch; Electronics packaging",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081537311

In this paper we compare the dynamic characteristics of cytokines feedback response to exercise in n=12 veterans diagnosed with Gulf War Illness (GWI) and n=12 healthy veterans deployed to the same theatre of operations. A third-order transfer function is used to model the process dynamics of 18 cytokines projected onto principal components with a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller enforcing the homeostatic regulation of these co-expression patterns. Transfer functions were fit to each subject for each principal component and the dynamic response parameters compared between the veteran control and GWI subject groups. Results of this analysis indicate that while much of the regulatory response dynamics are shared by both groups, there is a significant difference in the damping of the Th1:Th2 cytokine response to exercise in Gulf War Illness. © 2019 Association of Computing Machinery.","Exercise response; Feedback control; Gulf War Illness; Immune dynamics; Oscillatory behavior","Bioinformatics; Diseases; Dynamics; Feedback control; Medical informatics; Proportional control systems; Transfer functions; Two term control systems; Dynamic characteristics; Exercise response; Gulf War; Homeostatic regulations; Oscillatory behaviors; Principal Components; Proportional integral derivative controllers; Response parameters; Feedback; Control Systems; Diseases; Dynamics; Feedback Control; Patterns; Persian Gulf; Processes; Transfer Functions",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073170631

An integral analysis of the transport equations resulting in a system of ordinary differential equations was solved numerically. Impingement on superhydrophobic surfaces greatly reduces the heat transfer that occurs relative to a smooth surface due to gas trapped in cavities on the surface. This results in an apparent slip velocity and temperature jump at the surface. Local and average Nusselt numbers are presented as a function of radial position (0 to 45 jet radii), jet Reynolds number (3×103 to 1.5×104), liquid Prandtl number (2 to 11), normalized slip length (0 to 0.2), and normalized temperature jump length (0 to 0.2). All results are compared to classical (no-slip, no temperature jump) behavior on a smooth surface. Although local Nusselt numbers for the isoflux scenario are greater than the corresponding isothermal case, the difference in Nusselt number between these two heating conditions becomes negligible as the temperature jump length increases to quantities realizable on superhydrophobic surfaces. These results may be utilized to explore heat transfer degradation in applications where smooth surfaces are replaced by superhydrophobic surfaces to avoid fouling. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Convective heat transfer; Isoflux wall; Jet impingement; Slip length; Superhydrophobic surface; Temperature jump length","Heat convection; Jets; Liquids; Nusselt number; Ordinary differential equations; Prandtl number; Reynolds number; Surface properties; Convective heat transfer; Isoflux; Jet impingement; Slip length; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Temperature jump; Hydrophobicity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067190059

Any perceptible distortion level must be greater than the JND. Based on this observation, a local binary pattern (LBP) is developed for image quality assessment. First, the JND map of the image is computed. The spatial and relative intensity relationships among pixels in a local neighborhood are employed to generate the proposed LBP based on the JND map. Then, image contrast is used as a weighting factor for the LBP histogram generation to characterize the structural and contrast information of the image. Finally, the contrast and structure changes due to image distortion are measured by calculating the similarity between contrast-weighted histograms of the reference and distorted images. Support vector regression is employed to pool the similarity to predict the quality. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed LBP can effectively and accurately measure image quality, which is consistent with the HVS. The proposed method achieves high consistency with subjective perception using 18 reference values and performs better than other state-of-The-Art reduced reference image quality assessment methods. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","image quality assessment; image structure; just-noticeable difference; local binary pattern; reduced-reference","Benchmarking; Graphic methods; Image quality assessment; Image Structures; Just-noticeable difference; Local binary patterns; Reduced reference; Image quality",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073079407

Men with ED generally complain failure to attain or maintain an adequate erection during sexual activity. The prevalence of ED is strongly correlated with age, affecting about 40% of men at age 40 and nearly 70% at age 70. A variety of chronic diseases, including diabetes, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, depression, chronic renal failure, obstructive sleep apnea, prostate disease, gout, and sleep disorder, were reported to be associated with ED. In this study, data retrieved from a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan were used for designing the clinical decision support system (CDSS) for predicting ED incidences in men. The positive cases were male patients aged 20-65 who were diagnosed with ED between January 2000 and December 2010 confirmed by at least three outpatient visits or at least one inpatient visit, while the negative cases were randomly selected from the database without a history of ED and were frequency (1:1), age, and index year matched with the ED patients. Data of a total of 2832 ED patients and 2832 non-ED patients, each consisting of 41 features including index age, 10 comorbidities, and 30 other comorbidity-related variables, were retrieved for designing the predictive models. Integrated genetic algorithm and support vector machine was adopted to design the CDSSs with two experiments of independent training and testing (ITT) conducted to verify their effectiveness. In the 1st ITT experiment, data extracted from January 2000 till December 2005 (61.51%, 1742 positive cases and 1742 negative cases) were used for training and validating and the data retrieved from January 2006 till December 2010 were used for testing (38.49%), whereas in the 2nd ITT experiment, data in the training set (77.78%) were extracted from January 2000 till Deceber 2007 and those in the testing set (22.22%) were retrieved afterward. Tenfold cross validation and three different objective functions were adopted for obtaining the optimal models with best predictive performance in the training phase. The testing results show that the CDSSs achieved a predictive performance with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, g-mean, and area under ROC curve of 74.72%-76.65%, 72.33%-83.76%, 69.54%-77.10%, 0.7468-0.7632, and 0.766-0.817, respectively. In conclusion, the CDSSs designed based on cost-sensitive objective functions as well as salient comorbidity-related features achieve satisfactory predictive performance for predicting ED incidences. © 2013 IEEE.","clinical decision support system (CDSS); Erectile dysfunction (ED); genetic algorithm (GA); National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD); support vector machine (SVM)","Artificial intelligence; Cardiology; Clinical research; Database systems; Diseases; Epidemiology; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Health insurance; Heart; Medical problems; Sleep research; Support vector machines; Clinical decision support systems; Erectile dysfunction; Hypertension; Indexes; Research database; Sleep apnea; Decision support systems; adult; aged; Article; chronic kidney failure; clinical decision support system; cohort analysis; computer prediction; congestive heart failure; controlled study; depression; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; erectile dysfunction; follow up; genetic algorithm; gout; human; hypertension; incidence; information retrieval; ischemic heart disease; jackknife test; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; middle aged; pathophysiology; predictive value; prevalence; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; sexual behavior; sleep disorder; support vector machine; training; algorithm; erectile dysfunction; factual database; young adult; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Support Vector Machine; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055711262

However, LBP-based methods are sensitive to noise, and some structure information represented by non-uniform patterns is lost due to the combination of these patterns. In this paper, a new local structure descriptor based on just noticeable difference (JND) for texture classification is proposed by exploring the spatial and relative intensity correlations among local neighborhood pixels. First, a JND map of the image is computed, and then we attempt to model the correlations among local neighborhood pixels by comparing the absolute differences in intensity between the central pixel and its neighbors with the corresponding JND threshold. A new visual pattern (JNDVP) is designed using modeled correlations to describe image structure. Next, considering that image contrast makes important contributions to structure description, contrast is employed as a weighting factor for JNDVP histogram creation to represent structural and contrast information in a single representation. Finally, the nearest neighborhood classifier is employed for texture classification. Results on two texture image databases demonstrate that the proposed structure descriptor is rotation invariant and more robust to noise than LBP. Moreover, texture classification based on JNDVP outperforms LBP-based methods. © 2019 Optical Society of America.",,"Image classification; Pixels; Textures; Absolute difference; Just-noticeable difference; Local binary patterns; Local neighborhoods; Nearest neighborhood; Non-uniform patterns; Structure information; Texture classification; Image texture; article; classifier; histogram; neighborhood; noise; rotation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071027640

Although most existing laminar micromixers attempted to reduce mixing time, our work focused on developing a system that can generate high-resolution images under a more stable flow, which results in more accurate kinetic analysis. Specifically, we developed a simple three-dimensional (3D) laminar micromixer, which distributes the sample stream to a 3D profile to address flow-instability issues caused by Dean vortices in a two-dimensional mixer. In the 3D mixer, the sample stream was successfully focused to a one-pixel width at the resolution of ˜200 nm/pixel, which approached the resolving power of an optical microscope and represented the highest imaging resolution ever achieved using a 3D mixer. Furthermore, we used the device to investigate the early folding kinetics of G-quadruplex under various sodium cation concentrations. Interestingly, a lag phase was found before the exponential phase during the folding process. Moreover, we obtained the G-quadruplex's observed kinetics of (1.51 ± 0.02) ×104 s−1, (1.68 ± 0.04) ×104 s−1 and (2.01 ± 0.02) ×104 s−1 at 50-, 100- and 200 mM NaCl, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Folding kinetics; G-quadruplex; Hydrodynamic flow focusing; Micromixer; Three-dimensional focusing","Focusing; Hydrodynamics; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Sodium chloride; Folding kinetics; G-quadruplexes; Hydrodynamic flows; Micro mixers; Three dimensional focusing; Mixers (machinery)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065577014

For all aluminas, heat treatment results in decreased surface area and increased pore diameter. Starting at 700 °C, metastable to stable phase transformation occurs, causing a substantial change in the pore structure of all aluminas. By 1100 (PA), 1200 (15 SDA) and 1200 °C (27 SDA), the transition to α-Al2O3 was complete, respectively. No α-Al2O3 is observed for 5 wt % silica doped alumina (5SDA) under thermal calcination. Calcination in steam and air, instead of in air only, results in enlarged pore size and depressed temperature of alpha phase transformation for all aluminas. Results show that the silica dopant modifies the pores of the alumina, stabilizes the oxygen lattice of γ-Al2O3, and retards α-Al2O3 formation. This study of the thermal and hydrothermal stability not only suggests the applicability of 5SDA for catalytic reactions occurring at high temperature in the presence of steam, but also contributes to a better understanding of the structural features responsible for the improved thermal stability of these aluminas. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Phase transformation; Pore structure evolution; Silica doped alumina; Thermal and hydrothermal stability; Transitional alumina","Alumina; Atmospheric temperature; Calcination; Catalysis; Phase transitions; Pore size; Pore structure; Silica; Stability; Thermodynamic stability; Catalytic reactions; Dopant concentrations; Doped alumina; Mesoporous alumina; Structural feature; Structure evolution; Thermal and hydrothermal stability; Thermal calcination; Aluminum oxide",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064311637

Creating effective tremor suppression devices requires a knowledge of where tremor originates mechanically (which muscles) and how it propagates through the limb (to which degrees-of-freedom (DOF)). To simulate tremor propagation, we created a simple model of the upper limb, with tremorogenic activity in the 15 major superficial muscles as inputs and tremulous joint displacement in the seven major DOF as outputs. The model approximated the muscle excitation-contraction dynamics, musculoskeletal geometry, and mechanical impedance of the limb. From our simulations, we determined fundamental principles for tremor propagation: (1) The distribution of tremor depends strongly on musculoskeletal dynamics. (2) The spreading of tremor is due to inertial coupling (primarily) and musculoskeletal geometry (secondarily). (3) Tremorogenic activity in a given muscle causes significant tremor in only a small subset of DOF, though these affected DOF may be distant from the muscle. (4) Assuming uniform distribution of tremorogenic activity among muscles, tremor increases proximal-distally, and the contribution from muscles increases proximal-distally. (5) Although adding inertia (e.g., with weighted utensils) is often used to suppress tremor, it is possible to increase tremor by adding inertia to the wrong DOF. (6) Similarly, adding viscoelasticity to the wrong DOF can increase tremor. Based solely on the musculoskeletal system, these principles indicate that tremor treatments targeting muscles should focus first on the distal muscles, and devices targeting DOF should focus first on the distal DOF. © 2019 by ASME.",,"Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Joints (anatomy); Muscle; Noninvasive medical procedures; Fundamental principles; Mechanical impedances; Musculoskeletal dynamics; Musculoskeletal geometry; Non-invasive treatment; Superficial muscles; Suppression devices; Uniform distribution; Diseases; abduction; adduction; arm muscle; Article; biomechanics; body position; daily life activity; dislocation; electromyography; essential tremor; excitation contraction coupling; human; impedance; muscle contraction; muscle excitation; muscle strength; nonlinear system; Parkinson disease; simulation; torque; tremor; upper limb; viscoelasticity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065513594

This paper introduces an improved synthetic basis feature descriptor algorithm that describes and compares image features in an efficient and discrete manner with rotation and scale invariance. It works by performing a number of similarity tests between the feature region surrounding the feature point and a predetermined number of synthetic basis images to generate a feature descriptor that uniquely describes the feature region. Features in two images are matched by comparing their descriptors. By only storing the similarity of the feature region to each synthetic basis image, the overall storage size is greatly reduced. In short, this new binary feature descriptor is designed to provide high feature matching accuracy with computational simplicity, relatively low resource usage, and a hardware friendly design for real-time vision applications. Experimental results show that our algorithm produces higher precision rates and larger number of correct matches than the original version and other mainstream algorithms and is a good alternative for common computer vision applications. Two applications that often have to cope with scaling and rotation variations are included in this work to demonstrate its performance. © 2019 by the authors.

As a result, 38 mid-rise buildings collapsed and several hundred more were damaged in Mexico City, and extensive damage was observed in the states of Puebla and Morelos. This special edition synthesizes observations related to structural and foundation performance, and the corresponding damage patterns, carried out by two UNAM-GEER engineering reconnaissance teams sent to investigate the geotechnical earthquake engineering aspects of this event. Articles were solicited of researchers that were in the field that investigated: the characteristics of the event, the demand and damage distribution across Mexico City and surrounding regions, the seismic performance of buildings, lifelines, and other critical infrastructure, considering the site response and soil-structure interaction effects in the observed damage distribution. Special attention was paid to the impact of regional ground subsidence, in the seismic-soil structure interaction exhibited by the affected building. Advanced non-intrusive survey methods were used to map damage patterns in a regional level. Comparisons were made between the observed building damage patterns following the September 19th, 1985 Michoacan earthquake, and the 2017 Puebla-Mexico City earthquake, and the distinct differences in the damage distribution between the two earthquakes were revised. Overall, building and foundation performance were observed to be quite good during the 2017 event, especially when compared to the 1985 event. Structures that were observed to be heavily damaged or collapsed were all built prior to 1985, and incorporated poor structural design and/or construction, which resonated with the soil column on which they were constructed, and/or were built upon very soft soils that contributed to significant foundation deformations. Detailed building damage pattern maps of specific neighborhoods that were investigated are provided, and lessons learned from this event are summarized in each research paper include in this special issue. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building damage mapping; Seismic foundation performance; Site response; Structural resonance","Buildings; Earthquakes; Geotechnical engineering; Piles; Seismic response; Soil structure interactions; Soils; Structural design; Building damage; Engineering reconnaissance; Foundation deformation; Foundation performance; Site response; Soil-Structure Interaction effects; Structural resonance; Surrounding regions; Earthquake engineering; building; damage; deformation; earthquake event; foundation; mapping; seismic response; strong motion; structural response; Mexico [North America]; Morelos; Puebla [Mexico]; Puebla [Puebla (STT)]",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065896666

Further, by collecting one observation every 12 minutes, rather than a subgroup of five every hour, the time-weighted charts of individual values result in a shorter ATS (average time to signal) than would be possible using Shewhart charts of subgrouped data. This article explores a similar strategy of monitoring process variability using time-weighted control charts and individual observations. The average time to signal a change in variability using these charts is studied when there are targets or known values for the in-control process mean and standard deviation. The results show that the ATS of both the Cusum and EWMA are substantially shorter than the ATS for the standard R charts or the more efficient S2 chart using subgroups of 5. The article also describes how the control limits for the EWMA chart to monitor process variability should be modified if the in-control process mean and standard deviations are unknown and must be estimated from a Phase I study.

The observers are designed in the body-fixed reference frame, while the velocity command and multirotor controller are developed in the body-level frame, independent of aircraft heading. This enables target circumnavigation in GPS-denied environments when only a camera-IMU estimator is used for state estimation and ensures observable conditions for the estimator.

This poses a problem when an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is tracking multiple ground targets on a road network larger than its field of view. We propose a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) to maintain individual target tracks and to perform probabilistic data association when the targets are constrained to a road network. This is particularly useful when a target leaves then re-enters the UAV's field of view. The RBPF is structured as a particle filter of particle filters. The top level filter handles data association and each of its particles maintains a bank of particle filters to handle target tracking. The tracking particle filters incorporate both positive and negative information when a measurement is received. We then implement a receding horizon controller to improve the filter certainty of multiple target locations. The controller prioritizes searching for targets based on the entropy of each target's estimate. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.",,,Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072289681

This paper compares the neutron soft-error reliability of an unmitigated and TMR version of a Taiga RISC-V soft processor on a Xilinx SRAM-based FPGA. The TMR RISC-V processor showed a 33× reduction in the neutron cross section and a 27% decrease in operational frequency, resulting in a 24× improvement of the mean work to failure with a cost of around 5.6× resource utilization. © 2019 IEEE.","fault injection; Fault tolerance; FPGA; radiation testing; redundancy; RISC-V; Single Event Upset (SEU); soft processor; Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)","Computer control systems; Error correction; Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant computer systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Neutron scattering; Neutrons; Radiation hardening; Redundancy; Space applications; Fault injection; Radiation testing; Single event upsets; Soft processors; Triple modular redundancy; Neutron irradiation",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074130861

Eight specimens were tested with varying column shape, block-out depth, and baseplate/anchor rod designs. The block-out concrete increased the connection flexural strengths by 69%-91% for block-out depths that were 1.2-1.5 times the column depth. A strength model proposed in previous work was found to reasonably predict the flexural strength, accounting for the effects of block-out concrete.

Following PWHT at 607 °C for 20 hours, the carbon-enriched zone exhibited little to no reduction in hardness although 20 pct hardness reduction occurred in the remainder of the first butter layer. This is because tempering of the martensite in the carbon-enriched zone was entirely offset by the formation of a high density of chromium carbides. In contrast, following PWHT at 607 °C for 20 hours the average hardness of the carbon-depleted zone decreased from 241 HV to 169 HV due to the elimination of martensite, ferrite grain coarsening and carbon depletion. In addition, the extended PWHT significantly enhanced the mismatch in mechanical properties between the carbon-enriched zone (351 HV) and the adjacent carbon-depleted zone (169 HV).

Each interaction is analyzed to determine properties that affect the likelihood of transmission, reflection, or absorption of the dislocation at the GB of interest. The results confirm the ability to predict the slip system of a transmitted dislocation using common geometric criteria.

In industrial inspection, it is important to collect the most relevant data to keep processing demands, both human and computational, to a minimum. This study investigates the viability of automated targeted multi-scale image acquisition for Structure from Motion (SfM)-based infrastructure modeling. A traditional view-planning approach for SfM is extended to a multi-scale approach, planning for targeted regions of high, medium, and low priority. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can traverse the entire aerial space and facilitates collection of an optimized set of views, both close to and far away from areas of interest. The test case for field validation is the Tibble Fork Dam in Utah. Using the targeted multi-scale flight planning, a UAV automatically flies a tiered inspection using less than 25% of the number of photos needed to model the entire dam at high-priority level. This results in approximately 75% reduced flight time and model processing load, while still maintaining high model accuracy where needed. Models display stepped improvement in visual clarity and SfM reconstruction integrity by priority level, with the higher priority regions more accurately modeling smaller and finer features. A resolution map of the final tiered model is included. While this study focuses on multi-scale view planning for optical sensors, the methods potentially extend to other remote sensors, such as aerial LiDAR. © 2019 by the authors.

Gyrostabilization is a potential option, but we do not currently know how to optimize gyrostabilization for tremor suppression. To address this gap, we present a systematic investigation of how gyrostabilizer parameters affect tremor suppression in a single degree of freedom (DOF). A simple model with a single DOF at the wrist and a gyroscope mounted on the back of the hand was used to focus on the most basic effects. We simulated the frequency response of the system (hand + gyroscope) to a tremorogenic input torque at the wrist. Varying system parameters one at a time, we determined the effect of individual parameters on the system's frequency response. To minimize the bandwidth without adding significant inertia, the inertia and spin speed of the flywheel should be as high as design constraints allow, whereas the distance from the wrist joint axis to the gyroscope and the precession stiffness and damping should be kept as low as possible. The results demonstrate the potential of gyroscopic tremor suppression and can serve as foundation for further investigations of gyroscopic tremor suppression in the upper limb. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","gyroscope; gyrostabilizer; hand; suppression; Tremor; wrist","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Frequency response; Technology transfer; gyrostabilizer; hand; suppression; Tremor; wrist; Gyroscopes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067179115

The most common algorithms used for this are ""drop in the bucket"" (DIB) and variations of the scatterometer image reconstruction (SIR) algorithm. These algorithms are also used for radiometer brightness temperature imaging. The Backus-Gilbert (BG) algorithm has been used for radiometer imaging but has not been applied to scatterometer backscatter imaging. In this paper, the application of BG to scatterometer backscatter imaging is explored and its performance is compared to DIB and SIR. Like SIR, optimally tuned BG is capable of producing higher resolution images than DIB, though its noise performance is slightly inferior to SIR's. While BG and SIR produce similar results for radiometer data, the higher relative noise level of scatterometer data increases the differences between the SIR and BG algorithm performance, and limits the performance of BG relative to SIR in scatterometer imaging. Comparison of the SIR and BG algorithms in scatterometer imaging offers important insights into the inversion/reconstruction problem. © 2018 IEEE.","Backscatter; Backus-Gilbert (BG); reconstruction; sampling; scatterometer; scatterometer image reconstruction (SIR); variable aperture","Backscattering; Image reconstruction; Microwave measurement; Radiometers; Sampling; Algorithm performance; Backus-Gilbert; Brightness temperatures; Higher resolution images; Scatterometer image reconstruction; Scatterometer Image Reconstruction algorithms; Scatterometers; Variable aperture; Meteorological instruments; algorithm; backscatter; brightness temperature; comparative study; data processing; image analysis; image resolution; imaging method; noise; radiometer; sampling; scatterometer",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058155266

We explore how students' audience awareness is facilitated by the case method, which presents students with a professional communication task within a workplace scenario. Situating the case: Case-method research suggests including a detailed audience and situation, multiple genres, and multimedia. Few studies have explored how case materials facilitate students' audience awareness. About the case: A 12-week case that was consistent with case-method research asked students to respond to an engineering firm's internal problem with a proposal and report. How the case was studied: Students from two sections of a genre-based course completed reflections about their audience awareness after the proposal and report. We qualitatively analyzed 51 reflections. Results/discussion: Students stated they could understand the facts about their primary audience but couldn't identify secondary and tertiary audiences. Students stated they could identify audience needs, but they disagreed about the amount of detail to understand those needs. Also, students stated they could respond to the audience using appropriate evidence and writing style.

The ABC employed were recently devised by Villamizar et al. (2017). They are derived from exact Farfield Expansions representations of the outgoing waves in the exterior of the regions enclosed by the artificial boundary. As a consequence, the error due to the ABC on the artificial boundary can be reduced conveniently such that the dominant error comes from the volume discretization method used in the interior of the computational domain. Reciprocally, the error in the interior can be made as small as the error at the artificial boundary by appropriate implementation of p- and h-refinement. We apply this novel method to cylindrical, spherical and arbitrary shape scatterers including a prototype submarine. Our numerical results exhibit spectral-like approximation and high order convergence rate. Additionally, they show that the proposed method can reduce both the pollution and artificial boundary errors to negligible levels even in very low- and high-frequency regimes with rather coarse discretization densities in the IGA. As a result, we have developed a highly accurate computational platform to numerically solve time-harmonic acoustic wave scattering in two- and three-dimensions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Acoustic scattering; Finite element; High frequency scattering; High order local absorbing boundary condition; Isogeometric analysis (IGA); Very low frequency","Acoustic field measurement; Acoustic waves; Boundary conditions; Discrete event simulation; Errors; Finite element method; Underwater acoustics; Volume measurement; Absorbing boundary condition; Acoustic Scattering; High-frequency scattering; Isogeometric analysis; Very low frequency; Acoustic wave scattering",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062872678

Using data from a large campus district energy system, equipped with centralized chilled water plants and a thermal energy storage tank, a novel technique is proposed to optimize this system in real-time, formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. This method, titled Quadratic Programming Hybrid with Augmented Constraints, is sufficiently fast to be computed in real-time for a district chiller system. This method is compared to both Branch and Bound and a simple logical decision algorithm in both speed and optimality. The proposed method for solving this mixed-integer quadratic programming problem proves very successful at achieving a near-optimal solution when compared to a standard Branch and Bound (BnB) algorithm. Although suboptimal, the proposed algorithm takes 99.96–99.99% less computational time than the standard BnB and computes an answer to within 29.9% of the BnB objective function. When compared to a simple logical decision algorithm, which represents an operator manually controlling the plant, the proposed method is estimated to yield 8.10–33.7% in savings on chiller energy costs. The Quadratic Programming Hybrid with Augmented Constraints algorithm shows potential for use in a real-time optimization application to exploit variable electricity pricing and significantly reduce the costs of running a chiller plant with thermal energy storage. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Chiller; Dynamic optimization; Mixed-integer quadratic programming; Thermal energy storage","Branch and bound method; Costs; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Heat storage; Power markets; Quadratic programming; Thermal energy; Water cooling systems; Chiller; District energy systems; Dynamic optimization; Intermittent renewables; Mixed integer quadratic programming; Near-optimal solutions; Real-time optimization; Thermal energy storage tanks; Integer programming",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059698784

Typically, the allograft acts as a scaffold to guide tissue regeneration with superior biocompatibility relative to synthetic scaffolds. Traditionally these scaffolds are machined into the required dimensions and shapes. However, the geometrical simplicity and, in some cases, limited dimensions of the donated tissue restrict the use of allograft scaffolds. This could be overcome by additive manufacturing using granulated bone that is both decellularized and demineralized. In this study, the large area projection sintering (LAPS) method is evaluated as a fabrication method to build porous structures composed of granulated cortical bone bound by polycaprolactone (PCL). This additive manufacturing method utilizes visible light to selectively cure the deposited material layer-by-layer to create 3D geometry. First, the spreading behavior of the composite mixtures is evaluated and the conditions to attain improved powder bed density to fabricate the test specimens are determined. The tensile strength of the LAPS fabricated samples in both dry and hydrated states are determined and compared to the demineralized cancellous bone allograft and the heat treated demineralized-bone/PCL mixture in mold. The results indicated that the projection sintered composites of 45–55 wt %.

The NVPSC model is an extension of a stochastic model for twin nucleation developed by Niezgoda et al. and a dislocation density based hardening law model developed by Knezevic et al. Beyond the baseline combined framework, the new model tracks sets of neighboring grains and allows twin transmission between them under certain conditions. The influence of grain boundary (GB) character is included in the stochastic models of twin nucleation and transmission. The starting texture from a rolled magnesium alloy AZ31B sheet was obtained using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) for initial input into the NVPSC. The sample was further deformed by uniaxial compression to encourage twin formation and the corresponding texture information was collected using EBSD. The accuracy of simulated twin activity was determined by comparing it with the twin activity seen in the deformed sample. The total number of predicted twins and the number of transmission twins is found to agree favorably with those observed via the EBSD scans. This validation demonstrates the significance of incorporating twin transmission as a twin formation mode in predictive models for this material. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.","Electron microscopy; Grain boundaries; Twinning; VPSC","Electron microscopy; Grain boundaries; Magnesium alloys; Magnesium printing plates; Nucleation; Stochastic systems; Twinning; Dislocation densities; Electron back scatter diffraction; Number of transmissions; Texture information; Uni-axial compression; Visco-plastic self-consistent; Viscoplastic self-consistent model; VPSC; Stochastic models",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044975634

Thus, during the Mw 8.1 09/19/1985﻿ subduction fault earthquake, and its strong aftershock Mw 7.5 09/21/1985, extensive damage was observed in the area, along with the loss of thousands of lives, despite these events had an epicentral distance of around 430 km from Mexico City. The observed damage was mostly due to site affects originated by the high plastiCity clay deposits found in the basin, which lead to large amplifications, and duration elongation of the ground motions coming from the epicenter. In addition, a frequency content modification occurs, which in turn, leads to a double resonance effect between the incoming ground motions, soil deposits, and the damaged buildings. Exactly 32 years after this devastating event, the Mw 7.1 09/19/2017 normal fault earthquake, reminded us of the importance of accounting for site effects, and most importantly the need to carry out a proper characterization of basin geometry, soil profile configuration, hydraulic conditions, and maintenance-structure periodic assessments of the building stock in Mexico City. This is required to reduce uncertainties of seismic vulnerability studies for extreme-event seismic hazard scenarios. In this paper, the role of site response and seismic soil-structure interaction as key factors responsible of the observed damage in the City is revisited, through series of 3D finite difference models of typical structure-foundation-soil typologies found at the areas where most of the damage was observed, highlighting its clear impact in the final damage distribution observed around the City. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Earthquakes; Infrastructure; Seismic risk; Site response; Soil-structure-interaction","Clay deposits; Deposits; Faulting; Seismic response; Soil structure interactions; Soils; 3d finite differences; Epicentral distances; Hydraulic conditions; Infrastructure; Maintenance structures; Seismic risk; Seismic vulnerability; Site response; Earthquakes; aftershock; earthquake damage; earthquake mechanism; finite difference method; risk assessment; seismic response; site effect; site investigation; soil profile; soil-structure interaction; subsoil; three-dimensional modeling; urban area; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063441170

Standard AM processes such as extrusion can produce substrates on which electrical traces can be deposited. However, the surface roughness of plastic extrusion reduces the effective electrical conductivity and can introduce anisotropy, especially in radio frequency (RF) devices. The roughness can be reduced using vapor smoothing (VS), but solvent absorption changes the surface composition slightly, can be environmentally hazardous, and is not feasible with all thermoplastics. A new method introduced here - coined thermal smoothing (TS) - utilizes a heat source to locally reflow the material, thus minimizing the roughness of the undulating surfaces without the drawbacks of VS. This research work compares the surface roughness impacts of both smoothing processes with profilometry and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Both smoothing processes significantly reduce the surface roughness of extruded components by 80% and 90% for TS and VS, respectively. This paper also examines the influence of surface smoothing on high-frequency conductivity of microdispensed conductors (CB028 paste) deposited on the substrates.

They followed a detailed characterization procedure and also completed a questionnaire on their set-up and analysis methods. Excluding outliers (2 of 20), the average coefficient of variation (c v ) between the participant's results was 32% and 44% (non-crimp and woven fabric), while the average c v for individual participants was 8% and 12%, respectively.

Labeled proteins can then be selectively conjugated to fluorophores, affinity reagents, peptides, polymers, nanoparticles or surfaces for a wide variety of downstream applications in proteomics and biotechnology. In this review, we focus on techniques in which proteins are residue- and site-specifically labeled with ncAAs containing bioorthogonal handles. These ncAA-labeled proteins are: readily enriched from cells and tissues for identification via mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis; selectively purified for downstream biotechnology applications; or labeled with fluorophores for in situ analysis. To facilitate the wider use of these techniques, we provide decision trees to help guide the design of future experiments. It is expected that the use of ncAA labeling will continue to expand into new application areas where spatial and temporal analysis of proteome dynamics and engineering new chemistries and new function into proteins are desired. © 2019 The Author(s).","Bioorthogonal chemistry; Biotechnology; Metabolic labeling; Proteomics; Residue-specific labeling; Site-specific labeling","proteome; transfer RNA; amino acid labeling; amino terminal sequence; bioengineering; biotechnology; chemical labeling; chemical structure; click chemistry; cycloaddition; decision tree; disulfide bond; mass spectrometry; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein synthesis; proteomics; quorum sensing; Review; structure activity relation",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067181145

Design: Fifty-three participants with radiographic KOA (47% female, 62.3 ± 7.1 years, BMI = 28.5 ± 3.9 kg/m 2 ) were enrolled in 10 sessions of lower extremity strengthening over a 28-day period. Maximum isometric quadriceps strength and walking gait biomechanics were collected on the involved limb at baseline and 4-weeks following the strengthening intervention. Responders were classified as individuals who increased quadriceps strength greater than the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the minimal detectable change (MDC) in quadriceps strength (29 Nm) determined in a previous study. 2 × 2 functional analyses of variance were used to evaluate the effects of group (responders and non-responders) and time (baseline and 4-weeks) on time-normalized waveforms for knee flexion angle (KFA), vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), and internal knee extension moment (KEM). Results: A significant group x time interaction for KFA demonstrated greater KFA in the first half of stance at baseline and greater knee extension in the second half of stance at 4-weeks in responders compared to non-responders. There was no significant group x time interaction for vGRF or internal KEM.

Computer vision technology is being viewed as an effective tool for automatic food recognition for monitoring nutrition intake. Of the many food recognition algorithms in the literature, Bag-of-Features model is a proven approach that has shown impressive recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a small and efficient convolutional neural network architecture for Chinese food recognition, which is more applicable for resources limited platforms. Our network architecture is designed to model and perform a pipeline of processing similar to the Bag-of-Features approach. The main advantage of the proposed architecture, like other convolutional neural networks, is its ability to unifiedly optimize the entire network through back propagation, which is critical to recognition accuracy. We further compare and correlate our architecture with the traditional Bag-of-Features model in an attempt to investigate the similarities between them and identify factors that influence the recognition accuracy.

In this paper, the transfer matrix method is combined with D'Alembert's principle to develop a two-port dynamic stiffness model for analyzing the kinetostatics and dynamics of complex compliant mechanisms with serial-parallel configurations. In detail, two kinds of improved transfer matrices for parallel sub-chains are derived in a unified form by summarizing the common serial-parallel substructures in compliant mechanisms. Then, a two-port dynamic stiffness model describing the frequency-dependent input and output force-displacement relationship of compliant mechanisms is established. Based on the two-port dynamic stiffness model, procedures for solving the static and dynamic performances of compliant mechanisms are presented. The proposed approach is demonstrated by calculating the displacement amplification ratio, input/output stiffness, natural frequencies and forced dynamic response of two typical precision flexure manipulators. The advantage of the proposed approach lies in its capability to describe the simultaneous kinetostatics and dynamics for a large class of serial-parallel configurations with very few degrees of freedom (DOFs), differing from the previous Lagrange-based dynamic modeling methods in the context of compliant mechanisms and should be of interest to designers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Compliant mechanisms; Dynamic stiffness matrix; Flexure hinge; Micro-/nano positioning","Compliant mechanisms; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Hinges; Mechanisms; Stiffness; Stiffness matrix; Transfer matrix method; D' Alembert's principle; Degrees of freedom (DoFs); Displacement amplification; Dynamic stiffness matrix; Flexure hinge; Frequency dependent; Micro/nano positioning; Static and dynamic performance; Dynamics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066158580

This is a critical problem for most open-chain agents that more readily transmetallate in vivo, in comparison to macrocyclic compounds. Gadolinium diethylene tri-aminepentaacetic acid bis-glucosamide (Gd-DTPA-BIGA) is an experimental, open-chain contrast agent which has a significantly increased relaxivity coefficient in comparison to other GBCAs. This results in greater signal intensity and improved contrast enhancement. These superior imaging qualities initiated a search for a solution to the transmetallation of this agent. Plasma zinc is a well-known GBCA transmettalation agent. Since the base chelate of Gadodiamide (Gd-DPTA-Bis-Methylamide or Omniscan), DTPA-Bis-Methylamide (DTPA-BMA), readily transmettalates with and binds serum zinc, we hypothesized that a plasma “zinc sink,” may significantly reduce transmetallation of linear agents. 5% DTPA-BMA was added to a formulation of Gd-DTPA-BIGA, which was tested against the original formulation of Gd-DTPA-BIGA with 0.2% of the base chelate DTPA-BIGA. These formulations, including gadodiamide, were labeled with 153 GdCl 3 followed by infusion into cohorts of Sprague Dawley rats which were sacrificed at 1, 30 and 60 days. Internal organs were harvested, along with blood, skin and femur, and analyzed for residual gadolinium. A subset of tissues were also interrogated with ICP-MS. Labeled Gadodiamide and saline where used as controls. Conclusion: The addition of 5% DTPA-BMA, as a zinc binding agent, reduced the transmetallation of the linear agent Gd-DTPA-BIGA, in comparison to its original formulation supplemented with 0.2% BIGA. This result indicates that supplementing linear GBCAs with ancillary chelates may hold promise for reducing, or eliminating the biological archiving of gadolinium in tissues. In addition, this paper provides valuable animal data on the long term retention of gadolinium from linear based contrast agents. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","DTPA-BIGA; DTPABMA; Gadolinium retention; Gd-DTPA-BIGA; Gd-DTPA-BMA; ICP-MS; Transmetallation; Zinc sink","chelate; gadodiamide; gadolinium; gadolinium chloride gd 153; gadolinium diethylene triaminepentaacetic acid bis glucosamide; gadolinium pentetate derivative; pentetate bismetylamide; pentetic acid derivative; unclassified drug; zinc; chelating agent; contrast medium; gadodiamide; gadolinium pentetate; gadolinium-DTPA bis-glucosamide; organometallic compound; pentetic acid; zinc; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cohort analysis; contrast enhancement; controlled study; drug dosage form comparison; drug formulation; female; image quality; in vitro study; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; isotope labeling; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; zinc blood level; animal; bone; chemistry; femur; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Bone and Bones; Chelating Agents; Contrast Media; Femur; Gadolinium; Gadolinium DTPA; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Organometallic Compounds; Pentetic Acid; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Zinc",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060346024

Despite the World Anti-Doping Agency's ban on such practices, ABT abuse continues. Autologous blood doping (ABD) is challenging to detect because of the similarities between an individual's doped and undoped blood. Recently, Harrison et al. reported that high-speed capillary electrophoresis may identify ABD. In their work, first order derivatives of the electropherograms were used to identify doping. However, this method suffered from false negatives due to the subjective nature of the analysis. Here, we provide an informatics analysis of the data from this study, contrasting the results of traditional statistical methods and less traditional mathematical techniques. First, three well-known multivariate statistical tools: cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and partial least squares (PLS) are applied to develop calibrations and/or group electropherograms of undoped (0%) and doped (5% and 10%) blood samples. (These doping levels were chosen due to the low physiological effect of doping below 5%, with 10% corresponding to the approximate ‘gain' derived from the transfusion of a single unit of blood into an adult.) Different preprocessing and variable selection methods were considered. Due to variation in the electropherograms and the limited sample size, these methods were inadequate. We next considered four less commonly used mathematical/informatics tools: pattern recognition entropy (PRE), the Euclidean distance between vectors, a peak fitting/integration method, and the second moment (SM). Each of these techniques showed some ability to differentiate between the 0, 5, and 10% doped samples. We then evaluated the prediction capabilities of inverse least squares (ILS) models based on these summary statistics. An ILS calibration based on PRE, the Euclidean distance, and peak fitting/integration proved more successful than the PLS model at predicting levels of blood doping from the corresponding electropherograms; the ILS model distinguished between doped (5% and 10%) and undoped (0%) blood. This methodology may be applicable to other challenging informatics problems like determining risk factors for genetically linked diseases, robust pattern finding in peak-like data such as ChIP-seq, or other genomic sequencing for understanding the 3D genome. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Blood; Capillary electrophoresis; Cluster analysis; Genes; Informatics; Inverse problems; Least squares approximations; Multivariant analysis; Pattern recognition; Principal component analysis; Statistical mechanics; First order derivatives; Genomic sequencing; Inverse least squares; Partial least square (PLS); Physiological effects; Prediction capability; Variable selection methods; World Anti-Doping Agency; Blood vessels",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064078659

As usage becomes more widespread, airspace will become increasingly crowded. These high-density unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) situations will pose many unique challenges, including in conflict resolution. Using agent-based models, conflict resolution and the well-clear and action-distance concepts for small multirotor UAVs in dense environments were explored. Specifically, the safety and efficiency of several collision-avoidance mechanisms under different possible densities, accelerations, and action distances were investigated. The results suggest that selecting appropriate action distances and collision-avoidance mechanisms will be vital to maintaining safety and efficiency. Interestingly, excessive action distances quickly degrade performance: using a simple method under high-density conditions (1 UAV∕km2), well-clear distances above approximately 750 m have extremely low efficiency (∼1% as many deliveries accomplished in 5000 simulation hours compared to lower distances). More advanced algorithms also suffer from low efficiency at higher (∼1 km) response distances. Different definitions for near-midair collisions and their effects on system safety and well-clear distance are discussed. © 2018 by John Salmon.

The purpose of this study was to explore the ability of Losartan to inhibit the inflammatory signaling pathway of TGF-β1 observed during osteoarthritic progression in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and knee joint using a genetic mouse model. Methods: A murine OA model displaying the heterozygous chondrodysplasia gene (cho/+), a col11a1 mutation, was used to test this hypothesis. Following a 7-month treatment period with Losartan, the synovial joints were analyzed for histopathological improvement comparing two experimental groups. Tissues were fixed in paraformaldehyde, processed to paraffin section, and stained with Safranin O and Fast Green to visualize proteoglycans and collagen proteins in cartilage. Using the Modified Mankin scoring system, the degree of staining and OA progression were evaluated. Results: Results show heterozygous animals receiving Losartan having diminished degeneration of TMJ condylar and knee joint articular cartilage. This was confirmed in the TMJ and knee by a statistically significant decrease in the Mankin histopathology score. Decreased expression of HtrA1, a key regulator to the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, was demonstrated in vitro as well as in vivo, via Losartan inhibition. Conclusion: Using a genetic mouse model of OA, this study demonstrated the utility of Losartan to improve treatment of human OA in the TMJ and knee joint through inhibition of the TGF-β1 signaling cascade. We further demonstrated inhibition of HtrA1, the lowering of Mankin scores to wild type control levels, and the limiting of OA progressive damage with treatment of Losartan. © 2019 Osteoarthritis Research Society International","Chondrodysplasia (cho, col11a1); High temperature requirement A1 serine protease (HtrA1); Losartan; Osteoarthritis (OA); Temporomandibular joint (TMJ); Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)","losartan; serine protease HTRA1; transforming growth factor beta1; angiotensin 1 receptor antagonist; losartan; transforming growth factor beta1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; articular cartilage; chondrocyte; chondrodysplasia; controlled study; disease exacerbation; drug effect; drug efficacy; histopathology; in vitro study; in vivo study; joint degeneration; knee osteoarthritis; mouse; nonhuman; osteoarthritis; priority journal; protein expression; temporomandibular joint; TGF beta signaling; upregulation; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; diagnostic imaging; disease model; immunohistochemistry; knee; metabolism; mutant mouse strain; osteoarthritis; pathology; synovium; temporomandibular joint; Western blotting; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers; Animals; Blotting, Western; Cartilage, Articular; Cells, Cultured; Chondrocytes; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Progression; Immunohistochemistry; Knee Joint; Losartan; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Mutant Strains; Osteoarthritis; Synovial Membrane; Temporomandibular Joint; Transforming Growth Factor beta1",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060300041

This paper examines the impact of varying input pulse length on the accuracy of defect depth quantification as a function of the material properties. Simulations using both thermoplastics and metals show that measurement error is dependent on a nondimensionalized pulse length. The simulation results agree with experimental results for three-dimensional (3D) printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) components. Analysis and experiments show that defects can be accurately detected with minor modification to the standard methods as long as the pulse ends before the characteristic defect signal is detected. © 2019 by ASME.",,"3D printers; Polymer blends; Styrene; Surface defects; Surface testing; Thermography (imaging); Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Defect depth quantifications; Non-destructive test methods; Nondestructive testing method; Pulse thermography; Subsurface defect; Surface temperatures; Threedimensional (3-d); Nondestructive examination",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062598705

When conventional fusion welding is used for repair, intergranular cracks develop in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). Friction stir processing (FSP), which operates at much lower peak temperatures than fusion welding, was studied as a crack repair method for irradiated 304L stainless steel. A numerical simulation of the FSP process in 304L was developed to predict temperatures and recrystallized grain size in the stir zone. The model employed an Eulerian finite element approach, where flow stresses for a large range of strain rates and temperatures inherent in FSP were used as input. Temperature predictions in three locations near the stir zone were accurate to within 4%, while prediction of welding power was accurate to within 5% of experimental measurements. The predicted recrystallized grain sizes ranged from 7.6 to 10.6 μm, while the experimentally measured grains sizes in the same locations ranged from 6.0 to 7.6 μm. The maximum error in predicted recrystallized grain size was about 39%, but the associated stir zone hardness from the predicted grain sizes was only different from the experiment by about 10%. © 2019","Friction stir welding; Numerical simulation; Recrystallized grain size; Stainless steel","Computer simulation; Forecasting; Friction; Friction stir welding; Grain size and shape; Heat affected zone; Neutron irradiation; Nuclear industry; Numerical models; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Repair; Stainless steel; Strain rate; 304L stainless steel; Finite-element approach; Friction stir processing; Fusion welding; Intergranular crack; Lower peak temperatures; Recrystallized grain sizes; Temperature prediction; Austenitic stainless steel",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059350063

Most commonly, pose graph optimization is performed by finding the set of pose estimates which are the most likely for a given set of measurements. In some situations, arbitrarily large errors in pose graph initialization are unavoidable and can cause these pose-based methods to diverge or fail especially in cases where global inputs become available after some time after initialization. This letter details the parameterization of the classic pose graph problem in a relative context, optimizing directly over relative edge constraints between vertices in the pose graph and not on the poses themselves. Unlike previous literature on relative optimization, this letter details relative optimization over an entire pose graph, instead of a subset of edges, resulting in greater robustness to arbitrarily large errors than the classic pose-based or prior relative edge-based methods. Several small-scale simulation comparison studies, along with single and multi-agent hardware experiments, are presented. Results point to relative edge optimization as a strong candidate for solving real-world pose graph optimization problems that contain large heading propagation or initialization errors. © 2016 IEEE.","mapping; multi-robot systems; SLAM","Mapping; Multi agent systems; Multipurpose robots; Robotics; Edge constraints; Edge-based methods; Graph problems; Hardware experiment; Multi-robot systems; Pose graph optimizations; Simulation comparison; SLAM; Errors",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062635854

Three different compressive strengths of mortar, grout, and concrete masonry units were used. Grouts were made without and with a shrinkage-compensating admixture. The various components were combined to construct several hollow and grouted prisms, which were then tested. The results show that very high-strength blocks were not as efficient as medium-strength blocks and that there was a difference between the compressive strengths of ungrouted and grouted masonry; depending on the combination of the materials used, grouted masonry can be less or more efficient than ungrouted masonry. For one combination of materials, the shrinkage-compensating admixture was shown to be effective in reducing the grout shrinkage, and the grouted prisms constructed with that combination of materials were more efficient than their hollow prisms counterpart. Grouted prisms constructed with grouts without the shrinkage-compensating admixture were, on average, less efficient than hollow prisms.

The apparatus developed in this research included an impactor unit, a moving platform, a microphone for air-coupled sensing, a distance measurement instrument, and signal processing modules. Given the absence of an existing universal threshold for differentiating among intact and delaminated areas using the new device, a delamination detection threshold value was determined in a first field demonstration also involving chain dragging and coring of a concrete bridge deck. While the maps of the air-coupled impact-echo data and chain-dragging data exhibit a high degree of similarity and are highly consistent with the results of coring, a quantitative method of comparison also demonstrates the utility of the new device across a broad range of delamination percentages. Specifically, the results indicate that the percentage of the deck area determined to be delaminated using impact-echo testing was within 3 percentage points of that determined to be delaminated using chain dragging for 10 of the 13 deck test sections, which generally exhibited delamination percentages ranging from 7 to 21%.

Although the amplitude and kinetic energy of evanescent waves decay rapidly, if the wave reaches a turning depth, where N=ω, and moves into a region where N>ω, the evanescent wave becomes an internal wave. This work expands upon previous research of varying stratifications by investigating the kinetic energy density in internal waves generated by evanescent waves passing through a turning depth. An analytical model is presented and compared to synthetic schlieren experiments of two Gaussian-shaped topographies. The model and experiments both indicate that the kinetic energy density of internal waves increases with decreasing topographic slope, when the distance between the topography and the turning depth decreases and when the average Froude number in the evanescent region is close to one.

In order to study the embrittlement and recovery of steel, tensile tests were conducted on two different types of AHSS over time after hydrogen charging. Concentration measurements and hydrogen microprinting were carried out at the same time steps to visualize the hydrogen behavior during recovery. The diffusible hydrogen concentration was found to decay exponentially, and empirical relations were found for both types of steel. Hydrogen concentration decay rates were determined to be -0.355 /hr in TBF-980, and -0.225 /hr in DP-980. Hydrogen concentration thresholds for embrittlement were found to be 1.04 mL/100 g for TBF, and 0.87 mL/100 g for DP steel. TBF steel is predicted to recover from embrittlement within 4.2 h, compared to 7.2 h in DP steel. A two-factor method of evaluating recovery from embrittlement, requiring hydrogen concentration threshold and decay rate, is explained for use in predicting recovery after exposure to hydrogen. Anisotropic hydrogen diffusion rates were also observed on the surface of both steels for a short time after charging, as hydrogen left the surface through <001> and <101> grains faster than grains with <111> orientations. This could be explained by differences in surface energies between the different orientations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Crystallographic orientation; Hydrogen embrittlement; Recovery; Steel","Decay (organic); Hydrogen embrittlement; Recovery; Steel; Tensile testing; Advanced high strength steel; Concentration Measurement; Crystallographic orientations; Diffusible hydrogen; Empirical relations; Hydrogen concentration; Hydrogen diffusion; Microstructural evaluation; High strength steel",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054430682

This work explores the impact of a changing projected surface area and varying apparent radiative properties on the net radiative heat transfer of an accordion fold comprised of V-grooves. The net radiative heat transfer of an accordion tessellation is obtained by a thermal energy balance at the cavity openings with radiative properties of the cavities given as a function of various cavity parameters. Results of the analytical model are experimentally confirmed. An accordion tessellation, constructed of stainless-steel shim stock, is positioned to achieve a specified fold angle and placed in a vacuum environment while heated by Joule heating. A thermal camera records the apparent temperature of the cavity openings for various fold angles. Results are compared to apparent temperatures predicted with the analytical model. Analytically and experimentally obtained temperatures agree within 5% and all measurements fall within experimental uncertainty. For diffusely irradiated surfaces, the decrease in projected surface area dominates, causing a continuous decrease in net radiative heat transfer for a collapsing accordion fold. Highly reflective specular surfaces exposed to diffuse irradiation experience large turn-down ratios (7.5× reduction in heat transfer) in the small angle ranges. Specular surfaces exposed to collimated irradiation achieve a turn down ratio of 3.35 between V-groove angles of 120 deg and 150 deg. The approach outlined here may be extended to modeling the net radiative heat transfer for other origami tessellations. © 2019 by ASME.",,"Analytical models; Irradiation; Radiative transfer; Uncertainty analysis; Apparent temperature; Cavity parameters; Collimated irradiation; Experimental uncertainty; Irradiated surface; Radiative heat transfer; Radiative properties; Vacuum environment; Heat radiation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061059937

Of the most widely used energy harvesters, piezoelectric generators can generate more electric charge than their triboelectric counterparts with similar device size, thus are more suitable to make compact wearable devices. However, most high-power piezoelectric generators are made from lead zirconate titanate, making them undesirable for wearable applications due to the toxic lead element. In this study, a flexible piezoelectric generator (F-PEG) is fabricated with chemically stable and biocompatible Group-III-nitride (III-N) thin film by a layer-transfer method. The III-N thin-film F-PEG can generate an open-circuit voltage of 50 V, a short-circuit current of 15 µA, and a maximum power of 167 µW at a load resistance of 5 MΩ. Applications of the III-N thin-film F-PEG are demonstrated by directly powering electronics such as light-emitting diodes and electric watches, and by charging commercial capacitors and batteries to operate an optical pulse sensor.

Thus, the discovery of new manufacturing approaches that reduce these expenditures would be highly beneficial to the semiconductor industry. In comparison, living systems construct complex nanometer-scale structures with high yields and low energy utilization. Combining the capabilities of living systems with synthetic DNA-/protein-based self-assembly may offer intriguing potential for revolutionizing the synthesis of complex sub-10 nm information processing architectures. The successful discovery of new biologically based paradigms would not only help extend the current semiconductor technology roadmap, but also offer additional potential growth areas in biology, medicine, agriculture and sustainability for the semiconductor industry.

While FPGAs provide a number of important benefits to cloud computing environments, they are susceptible to radiation-induced soft errors, which can lead to silent data corruption or system instability. Although soft errors within a single FPGA occur infrequently, soft errors in large-scale FPGAs systems can occur at a relatively high rate. This paper investigates the failure rate of several FPGA applications running within an FPGA cloud computing node by performing fault injection experiments to determine the susceptibility of these applications to soft-errors. The results from these experiments suggest that silent data corruption will occur every few hours within a 100,000 node FPGA system and that such a system can only maintain high-levels of reliability for short periods of operation. These results suggest that soft-error detection and mitigation techniques may be needed in large-scale FPGA systems. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",,"Cloud computing; Crime; Error correction; Failure analysis; Logic gates; Radiation hardening; System stability; Cloud computing environments; Fault injection; FPGA applications; Mitigation techniques; Radiation-induced; Silent data corruptions; Soft error detection; Traditional computing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064394455

Although simulations or software models can be used to explore the design space of these applications, often the final behaviour can not be evaluated until the design is mapped to the FPGA and integrated into the target system. This may be because long run-times are required, or because the environment can not be adequately described using a software model. Once unexpected behaviour is observed, on-chip debug is notoriously difficult; typically a design is instrumented with on-chip trace buffers that record the run-time behaviour for later interrogation. In this paper, we describe instrumentation that can accelerate the process of debugging machine learning applications implemented on an FPGA. Unlike previous work, our instrumentation is optimized to take advantage of characteristics of this application domain. Our instruments gather useful domain-specific information about the observed variables instead of recording the raw values of those elements. Results show that the proposed instruments provide at least 17.8x longer visibility in the most conservative of our experiments at a low area and latency cost. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",,"Application programs; Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Machine learning; Program debugging; Design spaces; Domain-specific information; Latency costs; Low area; Machine learning applications; Runtimes; Software model; Target systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064411802

When failure occurs, it usually manifests as transverse buckling. Because this failure mode is closely related to transverse tissue stiffness, the purpose of this study was to develop a method for measuring the transverse Young's modulus of maize stalk rind and pith tissues. Short, disc-shaped stalk segments were used for this purpose. X-ray computed tomography was used to obtain the geometry of each specimen prior to testing. Each specimen was tested in two different configurations. Computed tomography data was used to create a specimen-specific finite element model of each test specimen. Data from the first testing configuration was used in conjunction with the finite element model to determine the Young's Modulus values for each specimen. The specimen-specific finite element models provided estimates of the stress states in the stem under transverse loading, and these stress states accurately predicted the location of failure in transverse test specimens. The entire testing method was validated using data from one test configuration to predict the structural response of each specimen during the second test configuration. © 2018","Finite element modeling; Stiffness; Tissue properties; Transverse compression; Young's modulus","Computerized tomography; Elastic moduli; Histology; Stiffness; Stress analysis; Testing; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Computed tomography data; Specific finite element; Structural response; Testing configurations; Tissue properties; Transverse compression; Transverse Young's modulus; X-ray computed tomography; Finite element method; article; compression; geometry; human tissue; maize; nonhuman; rigidity; stress; x-ray computed tomography; biomechanics; finite element analysis; mechanical stress; physiology; Young modulus; Biomechanical Phenomena; Elastic Modulus; Finite Element Analysis; Stress, Mechanical; Zea mays",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059563555

This paper defines many of the problems associated with developing effective control of soft, pneumatically actuated, inflatable robots, and proposes an approach to solving a subset of these problems. We show that we can obtain a global measurement of orientation for a given soft-robot link using two different types of sensors (not including motion capture). Given the orientation measurement, it is possible to estimate relative configurations of the soft actuators and joints. In order to validate the ability to control position and orientation at the end effector, we show a new method for calibrating the coordinate frames of two unrelated measurement systems. Then, using one of our configuration estimation methods, we demonstrate its viability by performing simple behaviors with a large-scale (approximately 1.5 m long) soft-robot platform attached to the K-Rex rover at NASA Ames in an outdoor environment. Our results also show the importance of soft-robot kinematic calibration and the sensitivity of a soft robot to simple perturbations in the structure like deflation and reinflation. Finally, we show that end effector error can be significantly reduced by doing a form of servoing. In summary, our approach and demonstrations show effective soft-robot configuration estimation and control for large-scale soft robots capable of performing manipulation tasks. © 1996-2012 IEEE.","Calibration; motion control; pneumatic actuators; pose estimation; robot kinematics; soft robotics; state estimation; visual servoing","Calibration; Estimation; Kinematics; NASA; Position control; Rhenium alloys; Robotics; Sensors; Configuration estimation; Configuration estimation methods; Global measurements; Measurement system; Orientation measurements; Outdoor environment; Position and orientations; Soft robotics; End effectors",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055702967

All surfaces tested were submerged in a 20 mm deep pool of water and heated from below to maintain a constant surface temperature, while the side walls of the pool were insulated, and the top was covered. Three thermocouples positioned in the pool obtain the average pool temperature. A heat flux sensor is placed directly beneath the surface to measure the heat flux supplied to the pool. Free convection heat transfer coefficients are obtained for the sub-boiling temperature range of 40–90 °C. Six surface types are studied: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures and additional sparsely spaced ribs to close off the cavities, circular posts, and circular holes. It is found that structured superhydrophobic surfaces provide cavities for nucleation to occur. More dissolved air effervesces from the water as the surface temperature increases due to an increased level of supersaturation and convection. The nucleation leads to large air bubble formations that reduce the overall convection coefficient when compared to the smooth surfaces. For the rib/cavity structured surfaces, the bubbles form in an anisotropic manner and are aligned with the surface structure. More bubbles are observed on the superhydrophobic surfaces where the cavities are bounded. Since water's ability to dissolve air is dependent on temperature, heat and mass transfer cannot be treated independently on any of the superhydrophobic surfaces studied here. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Natural convection; Nucleation; Superhydrophobic","Atmospheric temperature; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Lakes; Mass transfer; Microstructure; Natural convection; Nucleation; Surface properties; Surface structure; Thermocouples; Air bubble formation; Constant surface temperatures; Convection coefficients; Heat and mass transfer; Structured surfaces; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Superhydrophobic; Surface temperatures; Hydrophobicity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054812469

In the U.S., these efforts have resulted in national curricula and increased local expectations. The research on actual implementation often reports on efforts of single schools or districts. This paper provides a high-level description of the practices and challenges of teaching CS in K-12 across an entire state. To better understand how these efforts might increase CS education for all, we surveyed every public school in the state of Utah and analyzed enrollment data for all 19 Utah CS courses. The survey consisted of closed and open-ended questions about each school's current CS practices and personnel. Schools from 39 of 42 public school districts responded (including charter schools) representing 46.3% of the state's high schools, 39.3% of middle/junior high schools, and 28% of elementary schools. Course data indicated that enrollment in CS courses increased considerably in the past five years after the introduction of newer, more fundamental courses. Despite the general enrollment increase, there has been a markedly smaller increase in student enrollment in more advanced CS courses. In this paper, we discuss these and other surprising results, as well as challenges that educators reported in promoting and teaching CS. © 2019 IEEE.","CS education; CS for All; K-12","Curricula; School buildings; Surveys; CS education; Elementary schools; High level description; Local expectations; Open-ended questions; Public school districts; Public schools; Student enrollments; Teaching",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080101881

This configuration can be found in the nature and in many bioengineering systems where artificial capsules are driven by micro-pumps through micro-channels. The capsule is considered as a thin hyperelastic membrane, which encloses an internal fluid. As it has been demonstrated in the literature, this model represents a wide range of artificial capsules, for example, the alginate-based capsules, typically used in bioengineering applications. A hybrid isogeometric finite element method and boundary element method based on a T-spline discretization and formulated in the time domain is used to solve the mechanical and hydrodynamical equations.

From the streamlines that terminate on the array element loads, a geometrical shape can be assigned to the effective area of the array. These concepts provide an intuitive tool for understanding mutual coupling effects in antenna arrays. The decrease in directivity associated with mutual coupling effects, the so-called element-gain paradox, can be explained by the overlap of the element effective area shapes. The critical element spacing for the element-gain paradox effect can be predicted from the effective area shape for a single isolated array element. Antenna design for minimizing mutual coupling, which is of interest in multiple input multiple output communications systems, magnetic resonance imaging arrays, astronomical arrays, and other applications, can be guided by analysing the effective area shape for a single isolated array element. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Array antennas; element-gain paradox; mutual coupling; Poynting streamlines; receiving antennas","Dipole antennas; Directive antennas; Electromagnetic waves; Magnetic resonance imaging; Receiving antennas; Array antennas; element-gain paradox; Loaded antennas; Mutual coupling; Poynting streamlines; Shape; Antenna arrays",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056327262

Running such a large number of crack propagation simulations presents a significant computational challenge, making reduced-order models (ROMs) attractive for this task. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop ROMs that have sufficient accuracy and low computational cost so that these upscaling simulations can be readily performed. However, constructing ROMs for these complex simulations presents its own challenge. Here, we present and compare four different approaches for reduced-order modeling of brittle crack propagation in geomaterials. These methods rely on machine learning (ML) and graph-theoretic algorithms to approximate key aspects of the brittle crack problem. These methods also incorporate different physics-based assumptions in order to reduce the training requirements while maintaining accurate physics as much as possible. Results from the ROMs are directly compared against a high-fidelity model of brittle crack propagation. Further, the strengths and weaknesses of the ROMs are discussed, and we conclude that combining smart physics-informed feature engineering with highly trainable ML models provides the best performance. The ROMs considered here have computational costs that are orders-of-magnitude less than the cost associated with high-fidelity physical models while maintaining good accuracy. © 2018","Brittle crack; Crack interaction; Graph theory; Machine learning; Reduced-order models","Artificial intelligence; Brittle fracture; Computation theory; Crack propagation; Graph theory; Learning systems; Brittle cracks; Computational challenges; Crack interaction; Crack propagation simulations; Graph theoretic algorithm; Graph theoretic approach; High fidelity models; Reduced order models; Cracks",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056200375

In this approach, we propose the use of static, laser-induced, grating structures within the device substrate to break the leaky mode light into diffracted orders. We then propose to use carefully timed illumination pulses to select which diffracted order is visible to the eye at every display refresh interval (up to 100 kHz). Each of these orders becomes a view for a different image point. To describe this new method, we use K-vector analysis. We give the relevant equations and a list of parameters which lead to a near-eye geometry with little or no overlap in higher-order view zones. We conclude that it should be possible to increase the field of view of our bottom-exit, leaky mode devices by as much as one order of magnitude by simply adding a laser-induced grating structure to the substrate and by carefully timing the device illumination.

The optimized flight path is obtained by using nonlinear model predictive control to solve flight and energy system dynamics over a 24 hour period with a 15 second time resolution. The optimization objective is to maximize the total energy in the system while flying a station-keeping mission, staying within a 3 km radius and above 60,000 ft. The propulsion system design optimization minimizes the total energy required to fly the optimal path. It uses a combination of blade element momentum theory, blade composite structures, empirical motor and motor controller mass data, as well as a first order motor performance model. The battery optimization seeks to optimally size the battery for a circular orbit. Fixed point iteration between these optimization frameworks yields a flight path and propulsion system that slightly decreases solar capture, but signif-icantly decreases power expended.

We used non-dimensionalization to examine the effect vehicle properties had on search performance so the results can be applied to any domain size with any number and type of vehicle. We found that even if vehicles could only sense 10% of the grid area at any given time step, 92% of the grid could still be searched by using a vehicle with good maneuverability and endurance. Conversely, if the chosen vehicle had poor maneuverability 92% of the grid could still be searched by keeping the endurance high and increasing the amount of area the vehicles could sense at one time to 70% of the domain area.

Unsteady interaction between tip clearance flow and the detached normal shock inside of the blade passages became more prevalent at flow rates close to stall, and this unsteadiness likely provides a way for leading edge spillage to occur and initiate the stall process. Although reversed flow at the trailing edge plane was not observed to be more prevalent in simulations near stall than in simulations away from stall, the phenomenon was shown to occur in blade passages that were approaching a stall cell.

Technology that combines accurate temperature measurement and 3D spatial control of the temperature distribution is limited by common 2D layer-based microfluidic fabrication techniques but can be realized with 3D printed microfluidic chips. This work presents an iterative process to create a microfluidic chip using multimaterial 3D printing to improve temperature sensing and create an even temperature around a target volume. Through an iterative process, verification is presented of fluorophore viability (specifically CdTe quantum dots) after being secured in place by cured PR48 3D printing resin, thus confirming the possibility of fluorescent thermometry as an accurate non-contact temperature sensing method. Numerical analyses of various geometries of chip design iterations are also presented verifying spatially even heating due to the placement of heating sources in the microfluidic chip. Combining the fluorescent thermometry and improved heating will lead to improved temperature control in microfluidic devices.

Distributed electric propulsion could potentially decrease takeoff distances enough to enable thousands of potential intercity runways. This conceptual study explores the effects of a retrofit of open-bladed electric propulsion units. To model and explore the design space, blade element momentum method, vortex lattice method, linear-beam finite element analysis, classical laminate theory, composite failure, empirically based blade noise modeling, motor and motor-controller mass models, and gradient-based optimization are used. With liftoff time of seconds and the safe total field length for this aircraft type undefined, this paper focused on the minimum conceptual takeoff distance. It was found that 16 propellers could reduce the takeoff distance by over 50% compared with the optimal 2-propeller case. This resulted in a conceptual minimum takeoff distance of 20.5 m to clear a 50 ft (15.24 m) obstacle. It was also found that, when decreasing the allowable noise by approximately 10 dBa, the 8-propeller case performed the best with a 43% reduction in takeoff distance compared with the optimal 2-propeller case.

This paper proposes an automated process to identify mode shapes from gray-scale images of compressor blades within a jetengine. This work introduces mode shape identification using principal component analysis (PCA), similar to approaches in facial and other recognition tasks in computer vision. This technique calculates the projected values of potentially linearly correlated values onto P-linearly orthogonal axes, where P is the number of principal axes that define a subset space. Classification was done using support vector machines (SVM). Using the PCA and SVM algorithm, approximately 5300 training images representative of 16 different modes were used to create a classifier. The classifier achieved on average 98% accuracy when tested using a test set of approximately 2000 images given P D 70. The results suggest that using digital images to perform mode shape identification can be achieved with high accuracy.

This year we explored further integration of Instagram as an academic tool. This study included twenty-two undergraduate participants who prototyped five new classroom uses of Instagram: posting full student presentations, utilising Instagram desktop view as the primary in-class presentation tool, employing templates enabling a cohesive visual identity and a simple search process, and methods to enhance student comments. We surveyed course participants mid-semester asking students about their personal Instagram use, the value and purpose they felt Instagram had in the course, and on the usefulness of the presentation templates. We learned that while the majority of students use Instagram in their daily life, few of them make comments on personal or course posts and will only do so for credit. We also learned that while students might not enjoy using Instagram in the course, they find it of value and highly meaningful. Finally, the students prefer using formatted templates over an open style like PowerPoint to build their presentations in. These templates enabled the students to post their full presentations and created a visual cohesiveness for the account while providing a rudimentary search process for individual posts. We will continue using Instagram in future courses with the exception of requiring comments. We believe that students will reference their class posts in years to come, and as they do, it will re-enforce their design knowledge and provide evidence of their personal growth. © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

This study is inspired by existing play studies that continue to demonstrate the positive relationship between the freedom to be playful and psychological wellbeing. The methods used in this study include a consolidation of 99 anonymous free-response student surveys over the course of six semesters that are organised in terms of stress level and frustration word indicators. These comments provide a historical baseline for understanding the student perceptions of their classroom learning experience as it relates to their emotional wellbeing. We then compare those comments with comments made after a semester of playful interventions to discover how they differ. The results indicate that levels of “stress” and “frustration” were decreased with playful interventions, however students spent more hours outside of class lecture on their assignments and the overall student course rating nominally decreased. These results are discussed as well as how pedagogical changes to traditional classroom environments such as this may not only impact stress and frustration but also significantly contribute to the holistic learning experience for university students. © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

We have observed that in successful teams, the education and skills of team members matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work and view their contributions. We believe that there are distinct and innate differences between students in different academic disciplines when it comes to moral positions and these differences in worldview inherently causes friction in interdisciplinary teams. Consequently, we feel that if students could understand these differences extrinsically, they could potentially improve their experience within their interdisciplinary team work. We ran a pilot study with students from Brigham Young University comparing the industrial design, engineering and entrepreneurship majors using The Moral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham, Haidt & Nosek, 2008) This survey measures five facets of one’s moral position: Care/Harm, Fairness/Reciprocity, In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect and Sanctity/Purity. Results show that designers scored higher in liberal values than their more conservative leaning engineering and business student counterparts. These results support our hypothesis. Understanding the fundamental value differences between disciplinary training should reduce friction and enhance interdisciplinary team communication. This ability to appreciate other mindsets in order to communicate and effectively design with individuals from differing disciplines will be an “essential skill for workers in the coming decades” (Colombo and Grilli, 2005). © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

Personas are archetypes of the individuals who will use, maintain, sell or otherwise be affected by the products created by designers. Personas help designers better understand the person the product is designed for. Unfortunately, the process of collecting customer information and creating personas is often a slow and expensive process. In this paper, we introduce a new method of creating personas, leveraging publicly available databanks of both aggregated national level and information on individuals in the population.

Typically, the players' goals, action sets, and payoffs change from encounter to encounter, often in ways the players cannot easily model or control. These more realistic interactions, which we model as a form of stochastic game called interaction games (IGs), have attributes which prohibit the straightforward application of many often-used algorithms developed for RGs.

A simplified geometry with a vertical coal hopper feeding into a 0.635-cm diameter horizontal pipe was used to represent key elements of the feed system. Coal particles were transported with 20-atm CO2 gas. The feed system was required to maintain a steady flow of gas and solids at a coal flow rate of approximately 3.8 g/s and a CO2 to coal mass ratio in the range 1-2. Sensitivity of model results to mesh size and particle interaction sub-model settings was assessed. Two design concepts were evaluated. A gravity-fed concept was found to be infeasible due to inadequate coal flow rates even at very high CO2 to coal flow ratios. This was due to gravitational forces being insufficient to move the pressurized coal from the hopper into the CO2 stream at the desired rate. A fluidized bed concept was found to provide the desired coal flow rate and CO2 to coal flow ratio. CO2 injected at the hopper base first fluidized the vertical coal bed before transporting it through a horizontal exit pipe. A second CO2 inlet downstream of the hopper exit pipe was used to dilute the fluidized coal and increase pipe velocities to minimize coal drop out. The amount of coal transported from the hopper was dependent on the net CO2 hopper flow but independent of the CO2 dilution flow. This meant that the coal flow rate and CO2 to coal flow ratio could be controlled independently. Pipe exit coal flow rates were found to fluctuate at levels acceptable for steady burner operation.

Unfortunately, evidence to date suggests users are unable to do this. Accordingly, we study in detail how well users can locate and complete the authentication ceremony when they are aware of the need for authentication. We execute a two-phase study involving 36 pairs of participants, using three popular messaging applications with support for secure messaging functionality: WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook Messenger. The first phase included instruction about potential threats, while the second phase also included instructions about the importance of the authentication ceremony. We find that, across the three apps, the average success rates of finding and completing the authentication ceremony increases from 14% to 79% from the first to second phase, with second-phase success rates as high as 96% for Viber. However, the time required to find and complete the ceremony is undesirably long from a usability standpoint, and our data is inconclusive on whether users make the connection between this ceremony and the security guarantees it brings. We discuss in detail the success rates, task timings, and user feedback for each application, as well as common mistakes and user grievances.

However, recent lab studies have shown that users are unable to do this without being told in advance about the ceremony and its importance. A recent study showed that even with this instruction, the time it takes users to find and complete the ceremony is excessively long-about 11 minutes. To remedy these problems, we modified Signal to include prompts for the ceremony and also simplified the ceremony itself. To gauge the effect of these changes, we conducted a between-subject user study involving 30 pairs of participants. Our study methodology includes no user training and only a small performance bonus to encourage the secure behavior. Our results show that users are able to both find and complete the ceremony more quickly in our new version of Signal.

This is especially true for encryption because the cost of mistakes can be disastrous. Nevertheless, until now, mental models of encryption have only been tangentially explored as part of more broadly focused studies. In this work, we present the first directed effort at exploring user perceptions of encryption: both mental models of what encryption is and how it works as well as views on its role in everyday life. We performed 19 semi-structured phone interviews with participants across the United States, using both standard interview techniques and a diagramming exercise where participants visually demonstrated their perception of the encryption process. We identified four mental models of encryption which, though varying in detail and complexity, ultimately reduce to a functional abstraction of restrictive access control and naturally coincide with a model of symmetric encryption. Additionally, we find the impersonal use of encryption to be an important part of participants' models of security, with a widespread belief that encryption is frequently employed by service providers to encrypt data at rest. In contrast, the personal use of encryption is viewed as reserved for illicit or immoral activity, or for the paranoid. © 2018 by The USENIX Association All Rights Reserved.",,"Access control; Cognitive systems; Driving forces; Functional abstractions; Mental model; Personal use; Semi-structured; Service provider; Symmetric encryption; User perceptions; Cryptography",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067281351

We propose to measure tremor in clinical settings using the Leap Motion Controller (LMC), which is a markerless motion capture sensor that has a low cost, zero set-up time, and dynamic accuracy of 1.2 mm. However, the frequency response of the LMC has not been characterized, so its ability to track oscillations such as tremor is unknown. To characterize the frequency response of the LMC, we measured the position of a mannequin hand simultaneously with the LMC and a high-resolution encoder while the mannequin hand oscillated at various combinations of frequency (1–15 Hz) and amplitudes (0.01–30 mm). We calculated the magnitude ratio and phase shift of the LMC and found the bandwidth of the LMC to range from 0–3 Hz to 0–5 Hz for tremor amplitudes greater than the dynamic accuracy. This bandwidth is too small to accurately measure most tremors. However, we developed an inverse filter to estimate the actual tremor amplitude and phase despite the limited bandwidth. Over the combinations of frequency and amplitude mentioned above, the inverse filter estimated the actual tremor amplitude and phase with errors of 3% and 2%, respectively. © 2018","Frequency response; Leap motion controller; Markerless motion capture; Tremor","Bandwidth; Controllers; Motion control; Clinical settings; Dynamic accuracies; High resolution; Leap motions; Limited bandwidth; Markerless motion capture; Movement disorders; Tremor; Frequency response; Article; bandwidth; data processing; inverse filter; leap motion controller; oscillation; priority journal; tremor; biomechanics; movement (physiology); pathophysiology; tremor; Biomechanical Phenomena; Movement; Tremor",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057244622

These estimators have been adapted for 16-APSK from methods originally intended for use with QPSK and CPM. These methods consist of a coarse search and a fine search with an optional dichotomous search to improve accuracy.

Given the fact that coded systems tend to operate at lower signal-to-noise ratios than uncoded systems, the synchronizer must operate at these lower signal-to-noise ratios. For a 30 kHz frequency offset and a 10 Mbit/s 16-APSK signal, the conventional phase lock loop (PLL) system does not achieve consistent lock to be a useful approach. Consequently, a blind feed-forward approach, based on the FFT, and an initialized feedback approach based on the PLL were examined. The feed-forward estimator is capable of achieving BER ideal performance for Eb/N0 ≥ 6 dB using 1024 symbols. The feedback estimator, initialized using a feed-forward estimate based on 1024 symbols is also capable of achieving BER ideal performance for Eb/N0 ≥ 6 dB. Both synchronizers require a sufficiently good blind estimate: the estimate based on 2014 symbols appears to be the minimum value to achieve good performance. © 2019 International Foundation for Telemetering.

However, less research has been done on measuring the impact of these programs on the affected communities. This paper examines factors that practitioners believe are related to successfully delivering a desirable and transferable solution to affected communities. The authors identified 46 distinct factors from the literature that implicitly or explicitly are suggested to contribute to successful project outcomes. Formed as postulates in this paper, these 46 factors have been separated into 5 categories to assist understanding and implementing these factors into service learning programs. Lastly, different methods of analyzing and measuring project success and impact are discussed. Future methods for proving the viability of the 46 postulates are discussed as well.

The course is offered as a study abroad program where faculty lead a group of students across several countries to learn about global product development. This is accomplished in a 2-3 week time period consisting of visits to companies and universities as well as participation in cultural activities. While much research has been done on the benefits of study abroad, it remains unclear how effective study abroad programs are at helping engineering students, especially short-term study abroad programs. The purpose of this paper is to present and examine the benefits of a short-term, study abroad program to engineering students. Data was collected from students who have taken the Global Product Development Course over the past 15 years in a mixed methods survey. Trends show that technical and cultural visits positively effect engineering students in their perception of global product development.

These models are transcrease (across a crease) and deploy from a flat sheet. The first category is planar and has behavior similar to a four-bar linkage. The second category is spherical and behaves like a degree-4 origami vertex. These models are based on the zero-thickness assumption of paper and can be applied to origami patterns made from thin materials, limiting the motion of the base origami pattern through self-interference within the original facets. Model parameters are based on a desired fold or dihedral angle, as well as facet dimensions. Examples show model benefits and limitations.

Changes in the force applied during a nanoinjection and varying the number of repeated nanoinjections on the same cotyledon were observed. Too much force or too many repeated injections caused physical damage to the cotyledon.

Most existing methods for evaluating social impact indicators require direct human interaction with users of a product, such as one-on-one interviews. These interactions produce high-fidelity data that are rich in information but provide only a single snapshot in time of the product’s impacts and are less frequently collected due to the significant human resources and cost associated with obtaining them. A framework is proposed that describes how low-fidelity data passively obtained using remote sensors, satellites, and digital technology can be collected and correlated with high-fidelity, low-frequency data using machine learning. Using this framework provides an inexpensive way to continuously monitor the social impact indicators of products by augmenting high-fidelity, low-frequency data with low-fidelity, continuously-collected data using machine learning. We illustrate an application of this framework by demonstrating how it can be used to examine the gender-related social impact indicators of water pumps in Uganda. The provided example uses a deep learning model to correlate pump handle movement (measured via an integrated motion unit) with user type (man, woman, or child) of 1,200 hand pump users.

Mechanical hand pumps have a long history of helping people access clean ground water for drinking and daily use. Among the most ubiquitous are the India Mark II and III pump systems, for which there are more than 4,000,000 installed across the world. These are estimated to serve between 600M and 1B people. All pumps degrade in performance over time, requiring service; many do not receive it causing pumps to become dysfunctional. The purpose of this paper is to establish a baseline for nitrile seal performance of India Mark II hand pump systems. Understanding off-the-shelf performance and using it as a baseline is an important step toward understanding degradation of performance over time, which is the focus of a much larger study to understand – mechanically and socially – how hand pumps perform, degrade, and ultimately meet human needs. In this paper, 110 off-the-shelf nitrile seals that were purchased in Uganda were tested and the following was characterized: (i) geometric variation, (ii) material variation, (iii) leak performance, and (iv) correlation between these. The seal leak performance was found to be very robust to variations in geometry and material at zero cycles. This important baseline supports our future work to understand how and to what degree seals become sensitive to geometric and material degradation during use.

This motivates the necessity of having a neutral design standard for CAD models to facilitate generation, customization, and parameterization across multiple systems. Current standards often fail to incorporate file history, design intent, and are designed to be an intermediary format for translation. This research proposes a simplified, neutral design format based on XML that can be used to generate models in different CAD systems and versions. The format utilizes advanced features such as finding tools to address issues that arise due to directionality and selection without a user interface. To test the feasibility of the neutral format, scripts were made that generated a quadcopter and an airplane wing rib. Comparisons between the generated models in both NX and CATIA are performed to evaluate the accuracy, flexibility, and similarity of the results of the generated neutral XML design framework. © 2019 CAD Solutions, LLC.","Design intent; Neutral format; Parametric design; XML","User interfaces; Wings; XML; Design frameworks; Design intent; Design standard; Engineering companies; Multiple CAD systems; Multiple systems; Neutral format; Parametric design; Computer aided design",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061475059

Predicting and measuring heat transfer is critical to the design and operation of new boiler concepts. The individual contributions of gas and particle phases are dependent on gas and particle concentration, particle size, and gas and particle temperature which vary with location relative to the flame. A method for measuring the contributions of both gas and particle radiation capable of being applied in harsh high temperature and pressure environments has been demonstrated using emission from particles and water vapor using an optical fiber probe transmitting a signal to a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The method was demonstrated in four environments of varying gas and particle loading using natural gas and pulverized wood flames in a down-fired 130 kWth cylindrical reactor. The method generates a gas and particle temperature, gas concentrations (H2O and CO2), total gas and particle intensities, and gas and particle total effective emissivity from line-of-sight emission measurements. For the conditions measured, downstream of the luminous flame zone, water vapor and CO2 radiation were the dominant modes of heat transfer (effective emissivity 0.13-0.19) with particles making a minor contribution (effective emissivity 0.01-0.02). Within a lean natural gas flame, soot emission was low (effective emissivity 0.02) compared to gas (0.14) but within a luminous flame of burning wood particles (500 μm mean diameter) the particles (soot and burning wood) produced a higher effective emissivity (0.17) than the gas (0.12). The measurement technique was therefore found to be effective for several types of combustion environments. © 2018 The Combustion Institute.","FTIR; Particle combustion; Radiation; Temperature","Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Coal fired boilers; Electromagnetic wave emission; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Heat radiation; Heat transfer; Natural gas; Optical fibers; Particle size; Soot; Temperature; Water vapor; Biomass-fired boilers; Design and operations; Fourier transform infrared spectrometer; FTIR; High temperature and pressure; Measurement techniques; Particle concentrations; Particle temperature; Gas emissions",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052453036

As example devices, we first examine 3D printed pumps, followed by two types of selectable ratio mixer pumps, a linear dilution mixer pump (LDMP) and a parallelized dilution mixer pump (PDMP), which occupy volumes of only 1.5 mm 3 and 2.6 mm 3, respectively. The LDMP generates a selectable dilution ratio from a linear set of possibilities, while the PDMP generates a denser set of possible dilutions with a maximum dilution ratio of 1/16. The PDMP also incorporates a new 4-to-1 valve to simultaneously control 4 inlet channels. To characterize LDMP and PDMP operation and performance, we present a new, low-cost video method to directly measure the relative concentration of an absorptive dye on a pixel-by-pixel basis for each video frame. Using this method, we find that 6 periods of the active mixer that forms the core of the LDMP and PDMP are sufficient to fully mix the fluid, and that the generated concentrations track the designed dilution ratios as expected. The LDMP mixes 20 nl per 4.6 s mixer pump period, while the PDMP uses parallelized input pumps to process the same fluid volume with greater choice of dilution ratios in a 3.6 s period. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Dilution; Mixers (machinery); Pixels; Pumps; Active mixers; Active valves; Device operations; Dilution ratio; Inlet channels; Integrated structure; Relative concentration; Separate interfaces; 3D printers",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060936270

In this study, we present, for the first time, combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ellipsometric (SE) studies of aluminum oxidation as a function of MgF2 over a range of layer thickness (0-6 nm). We also show for the first time, dynamic SE data which, with appropriate modeling, tracks the extent of oxide growth every few seconds over a period of several hours after the evaporated Al + MgF2 bilayer is removed from the deposition chamber, exposing it to the air. For each SE data set, because the optical constants of ultrathin metals films depend strongly on deposition conditions and their thickness, the optical constants for Al, as well as the Al and Al2O3 thicknesses, were fit. SE trends were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. There is a chemical shift in the Al 2s electron emission peak toward higher binding energy as the metal oxidizes to Al+3. The extent of oxide growth can be modeled from the relative area of each peak once they are corrected for the attenuation through MgF2 layer. This generates an empirical formula: oxide thickness= k∗log(t) +b, for the time-dependent aluminum-oxide thickness on aluminum surfaces protected by MgF2 as a function of MgF2 layer thickness. Here, k is a factor which depends only on MgF2 thickness, and decreases with increasing MgF2 thickness. The techniques developed can illuminate other protected mirror systems. © 2019 SPIE.","Aluminum mirror coatings; FUV; Lifetime; Magnesium fluoride; Oxidation; Quality assurance; Spectroscopic ellipsometry; XPS","Alumina; Aluminum coatings; Aluminum oxide; Binding energy; Chemical shift; Deposition; Electron emission; Magnesium compounds; Mirrors; Optical constants; Oxidation; Photoelectrons; Photons; Quality assurance; Spectroscopic ellipsometry; Ultrathin films; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Aluminum mirrors; Appropriate models; Deposition chambers; Deposition conditions; Empirical formulas; Lifetime; Magnesium fluoride; Real time monitoring; Fluorine compounds",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074198285

Consequently, we have created our own stereolithographic 3D printer and materials that are specifically tailored to meet these needs. We review our recent work and show that flow channels as small as 18 μm x 20 μm can be reliably fabricated, as well as compact active elements such as valves and pumps.

We asked members of the computational optimization and wind communities to take part in the studies that we designed. Nine individuals participated. Case study 1 considered variations in optimization strategies for a given simple Gaussian wake model. Participants were provided with a wake model that outputs annual energy production (AEP) for an input set of wind turbine locations. Participants used an optimization method of their choosing to find an optimal wind farm layout. Case study 2 looked at trade-offs in performance resulting from variation in both physics model and optimization strategy. For case study 2, participants calculated AEP using a wake model of their choice while also using their chosen optimization method. Participants then used their wake model to calculate the AEP of all other participants’ optimized layouts. Results for case study 1 show that the best optimal wind farm layouts in this study were achieved by participants who used gradient-based optimization methods. A front-runner emerged with the Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer plus Wake Expansion Continua-tion (SNOPT+WEC) optimization method, which consistently discovered the highest submitted AEP. For case study 2, two participants found a similar layout that was judged to be superior by all five participants. It is unclear if the better solution resulted from an improved optimization process, or a wake model that was more amenable to optimization. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

We begin by describing the models used, including changes specific for use with gradient-based optimization. We then compare our models’ output to previously published model and LES results. Using the models described, we performed gradient-based wind farm layout optimization using exact gradients. Power production for the original and optimized layouts were recalculated using LES.

The thermal conductivity of these materials determines their ability to transfer heat from the reactor core to the surrounding coolant. Additionally, these actinide compounds are of interest in condensed matter physics because of the 5f orbitals and unique electron interaction, coupling, and scattering events that can occur. Because of the radioactivity of thorium and uranium, thin film measurements of actinide materials are used to limit the amount of operator exposure, but standard thermal characterization methods are not well suited for thin films. This paper presents the process of depositing thin film UOx and ThOx samples of nm-μm thicknesses and the results of thermal property measurements. Thin films were deposited on silicon and glass substrates via dc-magnetron sputtering using an argon/oxygen mixture as the working gas. The thermal properties of the films were measured by the Thermal Conductivity Microscope (TCM). This uses one laser to generate thermal waves and a second laser to measure the magnitude and phases of the thermal waves to obtain the conductivity of materials. The results of the research show that the UOx film properties are lower than bulk values and that the role of the substrate has a considerable effect on determining the measured properties. Future work aims at improving the deposition process. Epitaxial film growth is planned. Additional understanding of thermal property measurements is targeted.

In the past decade, due to its biocompatible nature, the medical field has expressed significant interest in magnesium for biodegradable implant applications. However, utilization of magnesium-based alloys in surgical implant applications is strictly limited by magnesium’s high vulnerability to corrosion causing premature disintegration inside the human body. Hydrophobic (non-wetting) behavior of metal surfaces has been proven to be beneficial for corrosion protection in academic literature. One way of achieving hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces on metal surfaces without using non-biocompatible coatings is creating uniform microstructures that would alter the wetting characteristics of the surface. This work focuses on creating uniform pillar shaped micro-patterns on smooth pure magnesium surfaces by utilizing a picosecond laser (λ = 355 nm). The study reports the effects of average laser power, partial laser beam overlap and number of laser scans on the height, steepness, roughness of the resultant micro-pillars. Information gathered from this study could be useful in creating more complex or finer micro-structures on magnesium and its alloys to alter their wetting or corrosion characteristics using laser ablation which is a fast, repeatable and an un-convoluted process.

These results are used to explain the relationship between inlet total pressure distortion, pressure-induced swirl, total pressure distortion transfer, total temperature distortion generation, and circumferential rotor power variation. It is shown that very large changes in pressure-induced swirl and distortion transfer and generation occur between near-stall and design, but only small changes are seen between design and choke. The greatest changes are shown to be near the tip. Local power variations are shown to correlate with total pressure distortion transfer and total temperature distortion generation.

In this paper, the results obtained from a proposed test method to evaluate the potential of efflorescence of ceramic blocks are compared to that obtained using the method described in ASTM C67. The proposed method was developed because until 2017 there was no Brazilian Standard to evaluate the efflorescence potential for brick and structural clay tile. The method uses 2Â ×Â 2Â ×Â 20-cm specimens immersed in 5-cm of distilled water for 5 days in recipients covered with a rubber membrane. The method uses smaller samples than the standard method and has a 5-day instead of 7-day duration. Ceramic blocks from ten manufacturers from different Brazilian regions were used in this study. Results from the standard test method indicated that blocks from three manufacturers were susceptible to efflorescence while the results from the proposed method indicated that the blocks were not susceptible to efflorescence. The discrepancy in results may have been caused by the very small size of the specimens and the large amount of water in the containers used in the proposed method. The amount of soluble salts in the small specimens may not have been enough to detect their presence and the soluble salts in the submerged part of a specimen may have simply dissolved by the water. © 2019, RILEM.","Ceramic blocks; Efflorescence; Masonry; Soluble salts; Test methods",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052290381

It pressurizes the fluid to delay the onset of cavitation, which can adversely affect performance in a centrifugal pump. In this paper, the performance of a water pump inducer has been explored with and without the implementation of a stability control device (SCD). This device is an inlet cover bleed system that removes high-energy fluid near the blade leading edge and reinjects it back upstream. The research was conducted by running multiphase, time-accurate computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations at the design flow coefficient and at low, off-design flow coefficients. The suction performance and stability for the same inducer with and without the implementation of the SCD has been explored. An improvement in stability and suction performance was observed when the SCD was implemented. Without the SCD, the inducer developed backflow at the blade tip, which led to rotating cavitation and larger rotordynamic forces. With the SCD, no significant cavitation instabilities developed, and the rotordynamic forces remained small. The lack of cavitation instabilities also allowed the inducer to operate at lower inlet pressures, increasing the suction performance of the inducer.

The problem requires estimating the relative pose between the vehicles. We assume that onboard inertial measurement units can provide roll and pitch estimates of the aircraft attitude. We examine the observability of other relative states needed to do the handoff problem. In particular, we consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the relative position between the aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a radar or a lidar sensor. We assume that the two aircrafts do not exchange their airspeed and turn rate information. Under mild assumptions, we show that the relative heading between the two aircrafts is observable. In the second scenario, we assume that only the bearing angle between the two aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a vision sensor. We prove state observability for maneuvers that are relevant to target tracking and handoff. We also present an estimation algorithm that uses a bank of extended Kalman filters to estimate the relative states.

In the considered configuration, a jet flame issues from a central nozzle into a vitiated coflow of hot combustion products from an array of lean H2/air flames. Centreline profiles for mixture fraction, temperature and mass fraction of O2 and OH obtained from ODT simulations with a planar and cylindrical formulation are shown and compared to measurements from Cabra et al. (2005). Additionally, two-dimensional renderings of the jet flame and scatter plots of temperature versus mixture fraction and OH mass fraction versus mixture fraction are provided. Although the application of ODT for reactive flows in jet configurations is not novel, the chosen lifted jet flame in a vitiated coflow represents a challenge for the model. The accurate representation of the subtle interactions of the hot coflow products with the cold unburnt jet flow are crucial for the reaction and autoignition of the jet (Cabra et al., 2005).

Among many factors shaping such commitments, the ethical climate within engineering degree programs specifically and universities more generally seems especially pertinent. Yet there remains a lack of research on, and understanding about, engineering students' perceptions of ethical climate, including how this changes over time and impacts their professional formation and values. This paper draws on an NSF-funded, mixed-methods, longitudinal research project conducted across four U.S. universities. The larger project aims to investigate perceptions and attitudes around ethics, social responsibility, and related concepts among engineering students. In this paper, we more specifically explore various facets of ethical climate across the three schools through a mixed-method explanatory study. We focus on quantitative survey measures (n=257) and qualitative interview data (n=33) collected from engineering students during their first and final years of college. We more specifically shed light on three main research objectives. First, we investigate how engineering students perceive ethical climate across the four universities. Second, we explore how students' perceptions of ethical climate change over time. Third, we look at how specific experiences may contribute to students' ethical climate perceptions, including changes over time. This study will appeal to engineering educators, policymakers and researchers who are interested in research on ethics, social responsibility, and related topics. By providing foundational insights about students' perceptions of ethical climate, we hope to inform strategies to improve the ethical climate at universities and ethical commitments of engineers. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

To this end, we conducted a three-phase redesign of the warning notifications surrounding the authentication ceremony in Signal. Our results show how improved comprehension can be achieved while still promoting favorable privacy outcomes among users. Our experience reaffirms existing arguments that users should be empowered to make personal trade-offs between perceived risk and response cost.

The ISAM is the process that was developed to execute the UICPM. The first step is to prepare the model input by combining the roadway and crash data files. Crashes are assigned to intersections if they are located with the functional area of an intersection. The second step is to execute the UICPM using the R graphical user interface (GUI) tool and R software.

In addition, LCC reduces the settlement of the underlying soils which is attractive to engineers. To evaluate the passive force-deflection curves for these materials, large-scale lab tests were performed with LCC and CLSM backfills in addition to a granular backfill for comparison. The response of the LCC was similar to that of the granular backfill with somewhat higher peak force developing at about 2.5% of the wall height. Although the stiffness was about twice as high as the granular backfill, the post-peak reduction was less than that for the granular fill.

The CLSM experienced a rapid decease in strength of about 60% after the peak strength was reached.

Recently, a PDMS based planar optofluidic platform was introduced that opens the way to rapid development and prototyping of unique structures, taking advantage of the positive attributes of silicon dioxide-based optofluidics and PDMS based microfluidics. Here, hydrodynamic focusing is integrated into a PDMS based optofluidic chip to enhance the detection of single H1N1 viruses on-chip. Chip-plane focusing is provided by a system of microfluidic channels to force the particles towards a region of high optical collection efficiency. Focusing is demonstrated and enhanced detection is quantified using fluorescent polystyrene beads where the coefficient of variation is found to decrease by a factor of 4 with the addition of hydrodynamic focusing.

Using a grounded theory methodology, we analyzed the interview data and found that participants chose their security posture based on the immense value the Internet provides and their belief that no combination of technology could make them perfectly safe. Within this context, users have a four-stage process for determining which security measures to adopt: learning, evaluation of risks, estimation of impact, and weighing trade-offs to various coping strategies. Our results also revealed that a majority of participants understand the basic principles of symmetric encryption. We found that participants' misconceptions related to browser-based TLS indicators lead to insecure behavior, and it is the permanence of encrypted email that causes participants to doubt that it is secure.

Keeping sponsors happy is important to these programs in order to ensure continued support from these industry representatives, so finding ways to improve project outcomes is critical. In order to find blind spots that students may have been left with after their first 6-7 weeks of instruction, we conducted structured interviews with students in capstone programs at Brigham Young University and the US Air Force Academy. These interviews were then transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes that may have been well understood or misunderstood by students. We found that a significant number of students had not understood concepts such as a design being more than a prototype, that sponsors have expectations for the tradeoffs between product cost and performance, or that they need to be thinking about how their designs might be deployed. It was also interesting to note that most students also reported feeling confident in their understanding despite their apparent lack thereof, indicating that these could represent major blind spots for students. We propose that developing methods for teaching these principles early on will help students see more clearly what their end goals need to be, and thus help them be more successful in delivering desirable designs.

They also tend to be the most unstructured portion of the project, and are often marginalized by teams who assume they already understand stakeholder needs and the best solution paths to pursue. Design researchers have developed methods shown to increase the creativity and divergent thinking of the design team during these initial phases of design. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on only a vague or amorphous representation of the design space (the set of all possible concepts the design team could feasibly select to meet the objective of the project). In this paper, we introduce a particular design-space structure that can help teams ideate and evaluate their ideation, thus improving the early phases of the design process. The design space presented here is a vector space with a basis of technology (the physical product people will use) and tactics (the procedure for using the product). Also presented are definitions, principles, and sub-theories that facilitate the creation and use of technology-tactics plots to represent the design space. Considering the design space in this structured way, the design team can gain valuable insights that improve the effectiveness of the initial stages of design, and may yield additional benefits to the design process as a whole, if further developed.

The SLW model is a so-called global engineering model for prediction of radiation transfer in gaseous media. The model bases the gas radiative properties on local thermodynamic properties (temperature, species concentration, etc.), and has been developed for use with any arbitrary solver of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). This review first presents the fundamental groundwork for the SLW model, followed by the detailed theoretical development of the model with associated publication references. The model was first formulated for isothermal, homogeneous single-component gases. As part of this formulation a new gas property distribution function, the Absorption Line Blackbody Distribution Function (ALBDF) was proposed, and the ALBDF has been generated from detailed spectroscopic databases for H2O, CO2, and CO over a range of gas temperature, mole fraction (where appropriate), and total pressure. The SLW model was then extended to treat non-isothermal, non-homogeneous gases, mixtures of gas species, and model application in scenarios featuring non-gray particulates and/or boundaries. In all of its development the SLW model has been rigorously tested against benchmark line-by-line spectral integration solutions of the RTE using the same spectroscopic database as used in the generation of the ALBDF. Work continues on the refinement of the SLW model, enhancing its accuracy in prediction of radiative transfer. Finally, this review will summarize work-to-date utilizing the SLW model in coupled heat transfer scenarios—comprehensive combustion simulations, combined natural convection and radiation, etc. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gases; SLW model; Thermal radiation",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073145730

The gas-solid flow and pulverized coal combustion processes in an industrial precalciner were numerically modeled to understand the flow patterns and thermal processes in the system. The gas and meal flow rates and properties were measured on-site to determine the boundary conditions for the simulations and to validate the models. The upward swirl of the gas flow in the furnace helped disperse the particles and extend their duration in the precalciner. The O2 and CO2 concentration distributions indicated that the coal particles were well dispersed and fully combusted. The calculations showed that the precalciner outlet temperature was too high which reduces the thermal efficiency and may damage the preheater installed just after the precalciner. Finally, an optimized precalciner was proposed to improve the temperature distribution.

For even the simplest of products, the complexities of these three areas and their tradeoffs cause decision-making transparency to be lost in most practical situations. The existing field of multiobjective optimization offers a natural framework to define and explore a given design space. In this paper, a method for defining a product's sustainability space (defined by economic, environmental, and social sustainability objectives) is outlined and used to explore the tradeoffs within the space, thus offering both the design team and the decision makers a means of better understanding the sustainability tradeoffs. This paper concludes that sustainable product development can indeed benefit from tradeoff characterization using multiobjective optimization techniques - even when using only basic models of sustainability. Interestingly, the unique characteristics of the three essential sustainable development areas lead to an alternative view of some traditional multiobjective optimization concepts, such as weak-Pareto optimality. The sustainable redesign of a machine to drill boreholes for water wells is presented as a practical example for method demonstration and discussion.

Because these devices can include complicated topography, many existing methods for depositing antireflective layers are difficult, impractical, or unusable. Aim: To create a light-blocking antireflective layer that works well with complicated MEMS and sensor devices, a layer should be made that is cheap, simple, and can be deposited and patterned with high resolution at low temperatures. Approach: Light blocking is achieved using an aluminum layer. Suppressing reflection is achieved by mixing aluminum oxide nanoparticles in photoresist to create a layer that partially absorbs and partially scatters light. Results: The combination of a layer of metal and a layer of nanoparticles and photoresist completely blocks transmission of light and significantly reduces reflections across the visible spectrum, particularly for shorter wavelengths. The layer is also patternable to sizes as small as a few microns with high resolution. Conclusion: By combining a metal layer and a layer of nanoparticles in photoresist, a simple, cheap, and effective light-blocking antireflective layer can be created that is compatible with planar devices with complex topography. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","lithography; optics; photonics","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Light; Light reflection; Lithography; Metal nanoparticles; Optics; Photonics; Photoresists; Plasma diagnostics; Aluminum oxide nanoparticles; Anti-reflective layers; Complex topographies; Complicated topographies; High-resolution patterning; Nanoparticle suspension; Optical sensor devices; Reflection of light; Light transmission",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062638342

Both pseudo-probabilistic and probabilistic (i.e., performance-based) methods are assessed and compared. Results of the comparative study suggest that pseudo-probabilistic methods can significantly overestimate liquefaction hazards in areas of low seismicity. Performance-based probabilistic methods are shown to predict between 5.2 cm and 16.5 cm (approximately 36–47%) less post-liquefaction free-field settlement on average than pseudo-probabilistic methods in areas of low seismicity at a return period of 2475 years, and to predict 9 cm to 19.7cm (approximately 96%) less post-liquefaction free-field settlement on average than pseudo-probabilistic methods at a return period of 475 years. Soil site classification is shown to have substantial impact on the estimated liquefaction hazards in areas of low seismicity due to soil amplification, potentially increasing design accelerations by up to 56%. Consequences of inconsistencies regarding design ground motions in current seismic design provisions are also discussed. To avoid potential for overpredicting liquefaction hazards, engineers should apply a performance-based approach when assessing liquefaction triggering and its effects in areas of low to moderate seismicity. © 2018 The Authors",,"Hazards; Seismic design; Seismology; Comparative studies; Design ground motion; Liquefaction hazards; Low to moderate seismicity; Performance based; Performance based approach; Probabilistic methods; Soil amplification; Soil liquefaction; earthquake engineering; estimation method; ground motion; hazard assessment; liquefaction; prediction; probability; seismicity; site investigation; soil classification; trigger mechanism",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056621949

Applying TMR to the design successfully reduces the design's neutron cross section by 80×. The effectiveness of TMR, however, is limited by the presence of single bits in the configuration memory which cause more than one TMR domain to fail simultaneously. We present three strategies to mitigate against these failures and improve the effectiveness of TMR: incremental routing, incremental placement, and striping. These techniques were tested using both fault injection and a wide spectrum neutron beam with the best technique offering a 400× reduction to the design's sensitive neutron cross section. An analysis from the radiation test shows that no single bits caused failure and that multicell upsets were the main cause of failure for these mitigation strategies. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Configuration scrubbing; field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs); single-event effects (SEEs); single-event upset (SEU); triple modular redundancy (TMR)","Computer control systems; Fault tolerant computer systems; Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Maintainability; Mathematical models; Neutron scattering; Neutrons; Radiation hardening; Redundancy; Reliability; Static random access storage; Tunnelling magnetoresistance; Configuration scrubbing; Random access memory; Routing; Single event effects; Single event upsets; Triple modular redundancies (TMR); Tunneling magnetoresistance; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055715251

By measuring the pump-probe traces while ramping the pump intensity, we observed a clear change in the ultrafast pump-probe dynamics after the phase change. Correlation between the ultrafast dynamics in the femtosecond timescale and the amount of phase change observed in millisecond timescale indicates that accumulation of the excited states in the sample plays an important role in the acceleration of the phase change. The result clearly demonstrates the usefulness of our method, which could be applied to the investigation of multi-timescale dynamics in various irreversible phenomena.

Our approach significantly reduces the amount of density functional theory (DFT) calculations needed, resorting to DFT only to produce the training data, while structural optimization is performed using the interatomic potentials. Our approach is not limited to one (or a small number of) lattice types (as is the case for cluster expansion, for example) and can predict structures with lattice types not present in the training dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by predicting the convex hull for the following three systems: Cu-Pd, Co-Nb-V, and Al-Ni-Ti. Our method is three to four orders of magnitude faster than conventional high-throughput DFT calculations and explores a wider range of materials space. In all three systems, we found unreported stable structures compared to the AFLOW database. Because our method is much cheaper and explores much more of materials space than high-throughput methods or cluster expansion, and because our interatomic potentials have a systematically improvable accuracy compared to empirical potentials such as embedded atom model, it will have a significant impact in the discovery of new alloy phases, particularly those with three or more components. © 2018","Active learning; Alloy phase prediction; Cluster expansion; Interatomic potentials; Machine learning; Moment Tensor Potentials","Aluminum alloys; Artificial intelligence; Binary alloys; Cobalt alloys; Copper alloys; Density functional theory; Forecasting; Learning systems; Molecular dynamics; Niobium alloys; Niobium compounds; Palladium alloys; Quantum theory; Structural optimization; Ternary alloys; Throughput; Titanium alloys; Active Learning; Alloy phase; Cluster expansion; Interatomic potential; Moment tensors; Learning algorithms",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053831501

Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This paper presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new class of arrays that are self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR), which are described in this work. To understand the behavior of such systems, this paper presents the modeling and testing of an SDSR array using an origami flasher pattern and discusses the results for the performance metrics of stiffness and shape. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Poorly defined scope of work has been ranked as the one of the highest reasons for poor performance over which owners and construction stakeholders have control. An owner's requirements and expectations are specified during the programming phase of a project and these define a design's scope of work. One focus of Target Value Design (TVD) is making owner's value a primary driver of design by improving project definition during programming-thus optimizing the design phase. While the number of published research articles praising TVD has been increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding the application of architectural programming (AP) to Target Value Design exercises, which engage stakeholders in a design decision making process called Choosing by Advantages (CBA). CBA first requires identification of attributes that are of value to an owner. The purpose of this research was to explore the importance of architectural programming in helping to identify key attributes of value to an owner, and to report on a lean game designed and preliminarily validated by the authors to investigate the accuracy and perception of attribute identification through AP as represented by the game. © 27th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2019.

A three-way spectral decomposition quantifies the contribution from each noise type in the sound of a tied-down F-35B aircraft on a linear ground-based array spanning 35–152 deg. This large spatial aperture allows for detailed investigation into the spatial variation in broadband shock-associated noise and fine- and large-scale turbulent mixing noise. The spectral models used in the decomposition capture the main features of the measured spectra with three exceptions: 1) that the F-35B engine noise contains multiple spectral peaks in the maximum radiation region, 2) that the nonlinear propagation increases the high-frequency spectral levels, and 3) that the low-frequency levels in the maximum radiation region are less than those predicted by the large-scale similarity spectrum. The F-35B broadband shock-associated noise has the same characteristic shape and variation in peak frequency as overexpanded, laboratory-scale jets. However, the peak level and width exhibit different trends than laboratory-scale broadband shock-associated noise and those recently reported for the F/A-18E aircraft. The strengths and limitations of current models to represent the spatial variation in the spectral content of F-35B noise can guide research efforts to more fully understand the sound radiation.

The Sobrado Vallim was built as the house of the local coffee Baron. Since being unoccupied by the family, the building has served as a school and as the City Hall; more recently the building has housed a local community association. The first story is formed by rammed earth walls supporting a wood floor. The walls on the second floor are built with adobe blocks, and several wood columns embedded into the walls support the wood roof trusses. The building has been unoccupied for several years and a temporary shoring system has been designed and installed to prevent possible collapse. The analyses included measuring and defining the building structural elements to determine their capacity. The rammed earth walls compression strength was determined using flatjacks. Samples of the adobe blocks were obtained so that their physical and mechanical properties could be determined through laboratory testing. Thermography was used to assess the wood elements condition. The proposed structural solution was to maintain the shell of the building and construct a steel frame structure within the existing elements. The steel frame would reduce the span and partially support the roof trusses at their mid-length. The ends of the wood trusses would still bear on the existing second floor walls. The proposed solution reduced significantly the loads on the existing elements, allowing the form the building to be maintained. © 2019, RILEM.","Adobe; Conservation; Historical preservation; Rammed earth; Structural rehabilitation",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052312975

This study investigates the apparent source locations of events related to crackle for a high-performance military jet aircraft using an event-based, time-domain beamforming method. This method utilizes the cross correlation between adjacent microphones to determine the angle of propagation of an ensemble of shock-related events within the time waveform. This angle of propagation is then traced back towards the source to find the apparent source location. Based on the angle of propagation, derivative skewness, and overall sound pressure level, the microphone pairs along the array can be sorted into six groups. With increasing engine condition, groups related to the presence of crackle tend to shift downstream and broaden, in qualitative agreement with the general aeroacoustic source locations. However, a comparison with near-field acoustical holography shows that the apparent source region of crackle-related events appears upstream of the overall energy at intermediate power but appear to converge at maximum afterburner. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, measurements of full-scale, high-performance military aircraft reveal phenomena that are not widely seen at laboratory scales. Recent modifications to LES methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high temperature ratio, in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly-heated, laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer shows evidence of four distinct field regions. The coherence between this line and complex pressures along the simulated jet lipline provide source regions in the jet plume corresponding to each field region. Differences in how information is transferred from the flow to the field suggests that the source regions represent different noise production mechanisms. The field regions compare favorably to some spatiospectral lobe features observed in measurements of an F-35B aircraft operating at afterburner, though do not reproduce all of the phenomena present in the aircraft’s jet noise field. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Although users may fail to heed a security warning for a variety of reasons, a major contributor is habituation, which is decreased response to repeated stimulation. However, the scope of this problem may actually be much broader than previously thought because of the neurobiological phenomenon of generalization. Whereas habituation describes a diminished response with repetitions of the same stimulus, generalization occurs when habituation to one stimulus carries over to other novel stimuli that are similar in appearance. Generalization has important implications for the domains of usable security and human-computer interaction. Because a basic principle of user interface design is visual consistency, generalization suggests that through exposure to frequent non-security-related notifications (e.g., dialogs, alerts, confirmations, etc.) that share a similar look and feel, users may become deeply habituated to critical security warnings that they have never seen before. Further, with the increasing number of notifications in our lives across a range of mobile, Internet of Things, and computing devices, the accumulated effect of generalization may be substantial. However, this problem has not been empirically examined before. This paper contributes by measuring the impacts of generalization in terms of (1) diminished attention via mouse cursor tracking and (2) users' ability to behaviorally adhere to security warnings. Through an online experiment, we find that: • Habituation to a frequent non-security-related notification does carry over to a one-time security warning. • Generalization of habituation is manifest both in (1) decreased attention to warnings and (2) lower warning adherence behavior. • The carry-over effect, most importantly, is due to generalization, and not fatigue. • The degree that generalization occurs depends on the similarity in look and feel between a notification and warning. These findings open new avenues of research and provide guidance to software developers for creating warnings that are more resistant to the effects of generalization of habituation, thereby improving users' security warning adherence. © is held by the author/owner.",,"Human computer interaction; Security of data; User interfaces; Basic principles; Carry-over effects; Computing devices; On-line experiments; Provide guidances; Software developer; User interface designs; Visual consistency; Mammals",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076108750

The Brazilian technical standard for clay masonry blocks aiming at attaining greater agility and flexibility in the construction process allows the use of bedding mortar instead of grout to fill the cells of the blocks. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of prisms filled with bedding mortar. Six classes of mortar and one type of clay block with nominal resistance of 6 MPa were studied. The results of the compressive strength of the prisms indicate the viability of using bedding mortar with the same structural function as grout. This article presents also an analytical study to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of clay block prisms filled with mortar. Analyses were conducted using general-purpose, nonlinear finite element software that simulates structural behaviour under different loading scenarios. A three-dimensional model of the prisms was developed using eight-node brick elements for both block and mortar with nonlinear properties assigned to each material.

The approach is based on rank aggregation, which meaningfully utilizes the correlation among the relevance ranks of predictor variables given by three state-of-the-art feature selectors: Relief-F, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), and maximum likelihood feature selection (MLFS). By applying the SVM combined with MVFS on a self-created dataset containing maximal and submaximal exercise data from 185 college students, several new hybrid VO2max prediction models have been created. To compare the performance of the proposed ensemble approach on prediction of VO2max, SVM-based models with individual combinations of Relief-F, mRMR, and MLFS as well as with other alternative ensemble feature selectors from the literature have also been developed. The results reveal that MVFS outperforms other individual and ensemble feature selectors and yields up to 8.76% increment and 11.15% decrement rates in multiple correlation coefficients (Rs) and root mean square errors (RMSEs), respectively. Furthermore, in addition to reconfirming the relevance of sex, age, and maximal heart rate in predicting VO2max, which were previously reported in the literature, it is revealed that submaximal heart rates and exercise times at 1.5-mile distance are two further discriminative predictors of VO2max. The results have also been compared to those obtained by a general regression neural network and single decision tree combined with MVFS, and it is shown that the SVM exhibits much better performance than other methods for prediction of VO2max. © TÜBİTAK","Ensemble feature selection; Maximal oxygen uptake; Prediction; Rank aggregation; Support vector machine","Decision trees; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Heart; Maximum likelihood; Mean square error; Neural networks; Students; Ensemble feature selections; General regression neural network; Maximal oxygen uptake; Minimum redundancy-maximum relevances; Multiple correlation coefficients; Predictor variables; Rank aggregation; Root mean square errors; Support vector machines",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072612849

Design: Ten individuals at high risk of developing hip osteoarthritis (SibKids) underwent contemporaneous T2 mapping and dGEMRIC in the hip (10 hips). Twelve healthy volunteers underwent T2 mapping of both hips (24 hips) at time points 25, 35, 45, and 55 minutes post offloading. Acetabular and femoral cartilage was manually segmented into regions of interest. The relationship between T2 and dGEMRIC values from anatomically corresponding regions of interests was quantified using Pearson’s correlation. The reproducibility of image analysis for T2 and dGEMRIC, and reproducibility of image acquisition for T2, was quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), root mean square coefficient of variance (RMSCoV), smallest detectable difference (SDD), and Bland-Altman plots. The paired t test was used to determine if difference existed in T2 values at different unloading times. Results: T2 values correlated most strongly with dGEMRIC values in diseased cartilage (r = −0.61, P = <0.001). T2 image analysis (segmentation) reproducibility was ICC = 0.96 to 0.98, RMSCoV = 3.5% to 5.2%, and SDD = 2.2 to 3.5 ms. T2 values at 25 minutes unloading were not significantly different to longer unloading times (P = 0.132). SDD for T2 image acquisition reproducibility was 7.1 to 7.4 ms. Conclusions: T2 values in the hip correlate well with dGEMRIC in areas of cartilage damage. T2 shows high reproducibility and values do not change beyond 25 minutes of joint unloading. © The Author(s) 2019.","compositional MRI; dGEMRIC; hip; T2 mapping",,Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064529722

Developable surfaces are shapes that a flat sheet can take without tearing or stretching, and they represent a wide range of manufactured surfaces. This work introduces “developable mechanisms” as devices that emerge from or conform to developable surfaces. They are made possible by aligning hinge axes with developable surface ruling lines to enable mobility. Because rigid-link motion depends on the relative orientation of hinge axes and not link geometry, links can take the shape of the corresponding developable surface. Mechanisms are classified by their associated surface type, and these relationships are defined and demonstrated by example.

Investigations on several systems revealed that nanoparticles have different thermodynamic properties than their bulk counterparts due to adsorbed water on their surfaces. Some thermodynamically metastable phases of bulk metal oxides become stable when reduced to the nanoscale, partially due to interactions between high energy surfaces and surface water. Water adsorption microcalorimetry and high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry, low-temperature specific heat calorimetry, and inelastic neutron scattering are used to understand the interactions of surface water with metal oxide nanoparticles. Computational methods, such as molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations, have been used to study these interactions. Investigations on titania, cassiterite, and alumina illustrate the insights gained by these measurements. The energetics of water on metal oxide surfaces are different from those of either liquid water or hexagonal ice, and there is substantial variation in water interactions on different metal oxide surfaces.

These microprocessors can be inexpensive and consume small amounts of power. However, the software running on these processors is vulnerable to radiation upsets. In this paper, we present a fully automated, configurable, software-based tool to increase the reliability of microprocessors in high-radiation environments. This tool consists of a set of open-source LLVM compiler passes to automatically implement software-based mitigation techniques. We duplicate or triplicate computations and insert voting mechanisms into software during the compilation process, allowing for runtime error correction. While the techniques we implement are not novel, previous work has typically been closed source, processor architecture dependent, not automated, and not tested in real high-radiation environments. In contrast, the compiler passes presented in this paper are publicly available, highly customizable, and are platform independent and language independent. We have tested our modified software using both fault injection and through neutron beam radiation on a Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller. When tested by a neutron beam, we were able to decrease the cross section of programs by 17-29 × , increasing mean-work-to-failure by 4-7 ×. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Silent data corruption (SDC); single-event upset (SEU); soft errors; software fault tolerance","Controllers; Error correction; Fault tolerance; Microcontrollers; Neutron beams; Neutron irradiation; Open source software; Open systems; Program compilers; Radiation hardening; Software reliability; Commercial off the shelves; High radiation environment; Msp430 microcontrollers; Processor architectures; Silent data corruption (SDC); Single event upsets; Soft error; Software fault tolerances; Software testing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058143035

Thanks to their low-cost, low-power consumption, and flexibility, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are among the promising devices to implement neural networks. Unfortunately, FPGAs are also known to be susceptible to radiation-induced errors. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of radiation-induced errors in the output correctness of two neural networks [Iris Flower artificial neural network (ANN) and Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) convolutional neural network (CNN)] implemented in static random-access memory-based FPGAs. In particular, we notice that radiation can induce errors that modify the output of the network with or without affecting the neural network's functionality. We call the former critical errors and the latter tolerable errors. Through exhaustive fault injection, we identify the portions of Iris Flower ANN and MNIST CNN implementation on FPGAs that are more likely, once corrupted, to generate a critical or a tolerable error. Based on this analysis, we propose a selective hardening strategy that triplicates only the most vulnerable layers of the neural network. With neutron radiation testing, our selective hardening solution was able to mask 40% of faults with a marginal 8% overhead in one of our tested neural networks. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Field-programmable gate array (FPGA); hardening; neural networks; reliability","Biometrics; Errors; Hardening; Logic gates; Low power electronics; Military vehicles; Neural networks; Neutron irradiation; Neutrons; Radiation effects; Radiation hardening; Reliability; Tunnelling magnetoresistance; Attractive solutions; Biological neural networks; Field programmable gate array (FPGAs); Iris; Iris recognition; Neutron radiations; Selective hardening; Tunneling magnetoresistance; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057879711

In particular, electronics can be embedded directly into structural components in nearly arbitrary 3D space. While these methods incorporate many of the same materials, the new processing methods require standard test methods to compare materials, processing conditions, and determine design limits. This work demonstrates a test method to quantitatively measure the adhesion failure of printed inks deposited on a substrate without changing the ink printing conditions. The proposed method is an adaption of single lap shear testing in which the lap joint is created by bonding the second substrate to the ink after curing. It was found that the interfacial shear strengths are independent of the adhesives used to attach cured conductive ink to the second substrate. In addition, chemical surface treatments of flame and plasma and mechanical sand-blasting increase the interfacial shear strengths by ~25% and 80%, respectively, while altering the adhesive failure mode to cohesive failure for most cases. This work also shows extruded substrates with undulated features increase adhesion strength; therefore, in addition to surface treatments, the geometric freedom of additive manufacturing (AM) could be leveraged to design surface features for enhanced adhesion. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Additive manufacturing; adhesion; conductive inks; printed electronics; single lap shear testing; surface treatments","3D printers; Additives; Adhesion; Adhesives; Chemical bonds; Conductive materials; Curing; Plasma theory; Processing; Soldered joints; Surface testing; Surface treatment; Testing; Adhesive failure modes; Conductive ink; Electronics manufacturing; Interfacial shear strength; Printed electronics; Processing condition; Single lap shears; Structural component; Substrates",Review,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073973593

Two mortars were tested, with volume proportions of cement: Lime: Sand of 1:0.5:4 and 1:1:6. From these two specimen heights, 50 and 140mm, with diameter of 45mm, resulting in diameter/height ratios of 1.0 and 0.3, were manufactured. The experimental results indicated that the confinement and strength of the mortar influence its stress-strain behaviour, the larger the confinement, the more, nonlinear the behaviour. In addition, the results indicated that the Poisson’s ratio and tangent modulus of elasticity vary with increasing applied load. Two numerical models were tested using the same finite element mesh, boundary conditions and load. The first model was based on the Total Strain Smeared Crack Model and the second model accounted for the observations from the experimental phase with a nonlinear “elastic phased” analysis, which updates the modulus of elasticity and the Poisson’s ratio at each new phase. The tangent modulus of elasticity was calculated directly from the experimental results while the Poisson’s ratio was approximated using the model proposed by OTTOSEN [16]. The numerical model based on the total strain smeared crack was not able to reproduce the behaviour of the compressed mortar near failure while the phased model presented satisfactory results, even close to failure, when cracking is significant. © 2019, International Masonry Society.

This paper discusses the design approach for fully compliant multistable mechanisms which employs a single bistable mechanism and several end-effectors connected in series. The force-displacement characteristics of the end-effectors are derived using the pseudo-rigid-body model.

As observed in the two past United States hurricane seasons, citizens are increasingly turning to social media whether as a consequence of their inability to reach 9-1-1, or as a preferential means of communications. Relying on past research that has examined social media use in disasters, combined with the practical knowledge of the first-hand disaster response experiences, this paper develops a knowledge-driven framework containing parameters useful in identifying patterns of shared information on social media when citizens need help. This effort explores the feasibility of determining differences, similarities, common themes, and time-specific discoveries of social media calls for help associated with hurricane evacuations. At a future date, validation of this framework will be demonstrated using datasets from multiple disasters. The results will lead to recommendations on how the framework can be modified to make it applicable as a generic disaster-type characterization tool. © 2019 Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, ISCRAM.

On a wettable horizontal surface, where a sufficient downstream liquid depth can be sustained after axisymmetric impingement, the jet forms a thin film on the substrate up to a radial distance where the film height suddenly increases, forming a hydraulic jump. On a superhydrophobic surface, where a downstream liquid depth is not naturally sustained, the thin film expands and breaks up into droplets, which are subsequently ejected in a random fashion outward, as carried by their radial momentum. In the present work, a facile, scalable, wettability-patterning approach is presented for delaying or even eliminating droplet breakup in the case of jet impingement on horizontal superhydrophobic surfaces. Analytical expressions for predicting the hydraulic jump and droplet breakup locations are developed to designate the proper wettability patterns that facilitate alteration and control of the postimpingement liquid behavior. The axisymmetric model is extended to evaluate the radial variation of the competing forces responsible for film breakup, and a design criterion for the effective wettability patterns is proposed. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,"Drop breakup; Electronic cooling; Hydraulic jump; Hydraulic machinery; Hydrophobicity; Jets; Liquids; Oscillators (electronic); Surface properties; Thin films; Wetting; Analytical expressions; Axisymmetric modeling; Fuel atomization; Horizontal surfaces; Liquid jet impingement; Patterning approaches; Radial variations; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Substrates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060893130

These deployment architectures are compatible with storable tubular extendible member booms, articulated trusses, or continuous longeron coilable trusses, all commonly used to deploy spacecraft structures. High areal packaging densities were demonstrated: 1.0 m2∕l for a diamond pattern with a high deployed aspect ratio and 0.5 m2∕l for spiral and serpentine patterns compatible with high and low deployed aspect ratios.

The M8.1 1985 subduction zone earthquake, which caused significant damage and loss of thousands of lives at 350 km epicentral distance, has become the quintessential example of the role that site effects can play in modifying the amplitude, frequency, and duration of ground shaking; and in aggravating the catastrophic consequences of earthquakes. We here present observations and analyses of the M7.1 September 19, 2017, event that -while triggered by an intraplate rupture at approximately half the epicentral distance of the 1985 event relative to Mexico City -caused severe structural damage to a few tens of buildings located in a relatively narrow zone between the hill and lake zones of the basin, known as the transition zone. We show that the M 7.1 mainshock exposed the vulnerabilities of the pre-1985 building code in the transition zone; but more importantly highlighted the improvement of the 1987 building code revision in terms of the performance of modern high-rise buildings that suffered catastrophic consequences during the 1985 Michoácan earthquake sequence. We next analyze several records collected at stations in the basin over the past 20 years. We highlight the importance of three-dimensional heterogeneity of the basin sediments, the coupling between hydrological setting and site response and their evolution with time, and the energy interaction between the deep basin edge and the shallow clay layers. Results presented are the collective effort of the GEER teams that were deployed to perform post-earthquake reconnaissance in the affected regions of the epicentral area and in Mexico City after the M 7.1 September 19, 2017, earthquake sequence. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Earthquake engineering; Geotechnical engineering; Seismic response; Soil mechanics; Structural analysis; Tall buildings; Catastrophic consequences; Earthquake sequences; Energy interactions; Epicentral distances; High rise building; Post-earthquake reconnaissances; Structural damages; Subduction-zone earthquakes; Earthquakes",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063480672

However, most models and source code have been recreated multiple times, which requires significant effort and energy with little additional benefit or step-wise improvements. The authors propose that it is time to form a coalition of industry and academic leaders to support an open source effort for drilling, to encourage the reuse of continuously improving models and coding efforts. The vision for this guiding coalition is to 1) set up a repository for source code, data, benchmarks, and documentation, 2) encourage good coding practices, 3) review and comment on the models and data submitted, 4) test, use and improve the code, 5) propose and collect anonymized real data, 6) attract talent and support to the effort, and 7) mentor those getting started. Those interested to add their time and talent to the cause may publish their results through peer-reviewed literature. Several online meetings are planned to create this coalition, establish a charter, and layout the guiding principles. Multiple support avenues are proposed to sustain the effort such as: annual user group meetings, create a SPE Technical Section, and initiating a Joint Industry Program (JIP). The Open Porous Media Initiative is just one example of how this could be organized and maintained. As a starting point, this paper reviews existing published drilling models and highlights the similarities and differences for commonly used drillstring hydraulics, dynamics, directional, and bit-rock interaction models. The key requirements for re-usability of the models and code are: 1) The model itself must be available as open source, well documented with the objective and expected outcomes, include commented code, and shared in a publicly available repository which can be updated, 2) A user's guide must include how to run the core software, how to extend software capabilities, i.e., plug in new features or elements, 3) Include a ""theory"" manual to explain the fundamental principles, the base equations, any assumptions, and the known limitations, 4) Data examples and formatting requirements to cover a diversity of drilling operations, and 5) Test cases to benchmark the performance and output of different proposed models. In May 2018 at ""The 4th International Colloquium on Non-linear dynamics and control of deep drilling systems,"" the keynote question was, ""Is it time to start using open source models?"" The answer is ""yes"". Modeling the drilling process is done to help drill a round, ledge free hole, without patterns, with minimum vibration, minimum unplanned dog legs, that reaches all geological targets, in one run per section, and in the least time possible. An open source repository for drilling will speed up the rate of learning and automation efforts to achieve this goal throughout the entire well execution workflow, including planning, BHA design, real-time operations, and post well analysis.

The focus of this study is the exploration of the south polar region of the Moon, a region that has not been visited by any human missions, yet exhibits a multitude of scientifically important locations – the investigation of which will address long standing questions in lunar research. This DRM architecture involves five landing sites (Malapert massif, South Pole/Shackleton crater, Schrödinger basin, Antoniadi crater, and the South Pole-Aitken basin center), to be visited in sequential years by crew, beginning in 2028. Two Lunar Electric Rovers (LER) are proposed to be tele-robotically operated between sites to rendez-vous with crew at the time of the next landing. With engineering parameters in mind we explore the feasibility of tele-robotic operation of these LERs between lunar landing sites, and identify potential high interest sampling locations en-route. Additionally, in-depth sample collection and return traverses are identified for each individual landing site across key geologic terrains that also detail crew Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA). Exploration at and between landing sites is designed to address a suite of National Research Council (2007) scientific concepts. © 2018 COSPAR","Design reference mission; Landing sites; Lunar exploration; Moon; Sample return; South Pole-Aitken basin","Landing; Lunar landing; Manned space flight; Moon; Poles; Space research; Design reference missions; Engineering parameters; Extravehicular activity; Landing site; National Research Council; Sample return; South polar region; South Pole-Aitken basins; Lunar missions",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053002436

Power system models have a number of features that makes their improvement challenging - they are multi-level, multi-user and multi-physics. Not surprisingly, they are nonlinear and time varying, both in terms of states (memory variables) and parameters, and discrete structures, such as graphs, are strongly blended with continuous dynamics, resulting in network dynamics. The transient stability models are used as a prototypical example. Our method is based on information geometry, and uses advances in computational differential geometry to characterize high-dimensional manifolds in the space of measurements. In the case of network parameters, a comparison is presented with circuit-theoretic techniques.

This is a time-consuming approach and there remains uncertainty in the crash data integrity. The surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM) was developed for resolving these issues. With SSAM, a conflict analysis is performed in a simulated environment. A planned improvement alternative is modeled and no physical installation of the alternative is needed. This study evaluated if SSAM can be used to assess the safety of a highway segment in terms of the number and type of conflicts and to compare the safety effects of multiple access management alternatives. An evaluation of the effect of converting a two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL) into a raised median on a section of an urban street was performed using SSAM working on VISSIM simulation’s trajectory files. The analysis showed that a raised median would be much safer than a TWLTL median for the same level of traffic volume, with approximately 32 to 50 percent reduction in the number of crossing conflicts. The analysis showed that about 34,000 to 38,000 veh/day would be the demand level where the median conversion is recommended for the four-lane study section. The study concluded that the combination of a simulation software program with SSAM could be a viable surrogate analysis approach for evaluating and comparing the safety effects of multiple access management alternatives. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.",,"Computer software; Safety engineering; Access management; Conflict analysis; Multiple-access management; Safety assessments; Simulated environment; Simulation software; Surrogate analysis; Traffic volumes; Highway administration",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047376928

The surface microstructures were geometrically defined by cavity fraction (the ratio of projected cavity area to surface area), pitch (the center to center distance between microfeatures), and feature height. Surface heat flux and surface superheat, the difference between the heated surface and the pool saturation temperature, were measured for each surface. Ten different micropatterned surfaces with post or rib geometries were considered with cavity fraction varying from 0.5 to 0.98, pitch varying from 8 to 40 μm, and microfeature height at 4 μm or 15 μm. The surface heat flux was measured across a range of surface superheats spanning 2–38 K. It is demonstrated for the first time that the transition from nucleate boiling to film boiling on rib patterned surfaces depends strongly on the cavity fraction. Increasing the microstructure height from 4 μm to 15 μm modestly increases the transition temperature. Nucleate boiling is more suppressed on post patterned surfaces than on rib patterned surfaces. Further, the rib structured surfaces exhibit a sudden transition from nucleate to film boiling while the post structured surfaces exhibit a gradual transition, with the vapor film growing slowly across the surface. Once stable film boiling is reached, the surface microstructure negligibly influences the heat flux for all surfaces. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Film boiling; Microstructure; Pool boiling; Post patterned; Rib patterned; Superhydrophobic surface","Evaporation; Geometry; Heat transfer; Hydrophobicity; Microstructure; Nucleate boiling; Surface properties; Film boiling; Pool boiling; Post patterned; Rib patterned; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Heat flux",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050671657

A generalized approach for identifying single-output mechanical advantage for a multiple-input compliant mechanism, such as many origami-based mechanisms, would prove useful in predicting complex mechanism behavior. While origamibased mechanisms are capable of offering unique solutions to engineering problems, the design process of such mechanisms is complicated by the interaction of motion and forces. This paper presents a model of the mechanical advantage for multi-input compliant mechanisms and explores how modifying the parameters of a model affects their behavior. The model is used to predict the force-deflection behavior of an origami-based mechanism (Oriceps) and is verified with experimental data from magnetic actuation of the mechanism. © 2018 by ASME.",,"Compliant mechanisms; Complex mechanisms; Design process; Engineering problems; Force deflection; Magnetic actuation; Mechanical advantage; Multiple inputs; Single input and single outputs; Mechanisms",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057021017

These dangerous countercurrents are known as submerged hydraulic jumps and are responsible for hundreds of fatalities at numerous low-head dams across the United States. The countercurrent creates high upstream-directed surface velocities across the width of the channel, making it nearly impossible for a trapped individual to escape. This submerged jump can occur for a range of upstream and downstream conditions. A multiple partial width deflector design for the downstream side of the dam was tested in the laboratory to determine effectiveness in completely or partially eliminating the submerged hydraulic jump. The results demonstrate that a dramatic reduction in upstream-directed surface velocities over a wide range of headwater and tailwater conditions is possible. The dam modification is relatively inexpensive, simple to install, and designed such that an individual will likely escape the submerged jump without severe injury or harm. The design is ready for prototype testing. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Hydraulic jump; Counter current; Head waters; Low-head dams; Partial widths; Prototype testing; Submerged hydraulic jumps; Surface velocity; Tailwater; Dams",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054509325

First-order slow equations are derived via the method of multiple time scales when the two small parameters are related by a rational power. We find that the resultant system depends only on the relationship of the two fast time scales, i.e. which fast time is fastest? Using the theory of cancellation of fast oscillations, we show that with the appropriate assumptions on the nonlinear operator of the full system, this reduced slow system is exactly that which the solution will converge to if each asymptotic limit is considered sequentially. The same result is also obtained via the method of renormalization.

The results showed the FA is better as a support of OC than the most commonly used Al2O3 in anti-carbon deposition and thus beneficial to the importance of the stability of FA supported OCs. Among all the tested OCs, the Cu-based OC synthesized with FA support and impregnation method demonstrated the best performance, with CH4 conversion of 94–100% and CO2 selectivity of 91–94% in ten cycles at 800–850 °C, and minor deactivation. The characterization of the fresh and spent OCs revealed that the FA support itself could provide 1.0–2.9 wt% active oxygen for fuel combustion, which is enabled by the iron oxide in FA. In addition, the distribution of Cu on the FA support became more uniform on spent OC than on the fresh one. Also, the partially irreversible CuO decomposition into Cu2O during cyclic tests was the main reason for the deactivation of OC. Thus, Use of FA as an OC support is conducive to both development of cost-effective CLC and an environmental-friendly utilization of waste FA. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-carbon deposition; Chemical looping combustion; Copper oxide oxygen carrier; Fly ash support","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Carbon dioxide; Chemical reactors; Coal; Coal ash; Copper oxides; Cost effectiveness; Deposition; Energy efficiency; Fly ash; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuels; Ionization of gases; Iron oxides; Methane; Oxygen; Waste incineration; Carbon deposition; Chemical looping combustion; Cost-effective approach; Environmental-friendly; Fossil fuel combustion; Impregnation methods; Oxygen Carrier; Thermogravimetric analyzers; Coal combustion; bioreactor; byproduct; carbon dioxide; coal combustion; combustion; decomposition; energy efficiency; fly ash; fossil fuel; inorganic compound; iron oxide; methane; performance assessment; technological development; temperature effect",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052324645

A platform for testing CAD in VR is developed through the integration of CAD software with a game engine and compared against traditional CAD methods through testing. Modeling capabilities included previews, creating solid rectangular prisms and spheres, lock to grid, and cuts of similar shapes. User testing with four different models (i.e. chair, maze, truck, sculpture) and survey responses suggest respectively that design in virtual reality promoted greater creativity in modeling, allowed for a greater feature creation rate, and that a slight majority of test participants preferred modeling in VR compared to traditional CAD applications. © 2018, © 2018 CAD Solutions, LLC.","3D printing. rapid prototyping; modeling; proof of concept; user testing; Virtual reality","Automobile testing; Integration testing; Models; Surveys; Three dimensional computer graphics; Virtual reality; 3-D printing; CAD applications; Development stages; Proof of concept; Rectangular prisms; Three-dimensional model; User testing; Virtual reality modeling; Computer aided design",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046007731

The objective of this work is to investigate the Integrated Spectral Band Ratio (ISBR) method for measuring the temperature of combustion product gases surrounded by radiating walls or within a mixture of gas and particles. Five conditions in a multi-fuel reactor were investigated using an optical probe. A Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer provided detailed spectral measurements of hot gas and particle emissions at wavelengths of 1.69–2.15 μm, focusing on a spectral region where H2O is the dominant participating gas. These measurements were used to infer the gas temperature of the flows. It was found that the measurement path length needed to be at least 0.25 m in order to obtain a signal large enough to infer temperature accurately. For four of the five operating conditions tested, optically measured gas temperatures were found to be in good agreement with the average temperature along the measured path as taken with a suction pyrometer (aspirated thermocouple). For these four operating conditions the particle media were optically thin. Temperatures for the in-flame fine wood particle condition did not exhibit as good of agreement due to high particle loading causing optically thick zones along the line of sight. Modeling experiments showed that when particles and gasses are optically thin, the optical gas temperature measured with this technique will be near the arithmetic mean of the line of sight temperature. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,"Combustion; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Temperature measurement; Thermocouples; Aspirated thermocouple; Combustion gas temperatures; Combustion products; Fourier transform infrared spectrometer; Operating condition; Particle laden flows; Physical limitations; Spectral measurement; Gas emissions",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050104153

Circular micropillars 4 μm in height with varying center-to-center distances (pitch) of 8 μm, 12 μm and 16 μm, are used to create the superhydrophobic surfaces. The range of surface temperatures explored is 110°C&lt;Ts&lt;337°C. An image processing algorithm was developed to quantify the temporal behavior of thermally induced atomization captured via high-speed photography. Results show thermally induced atomization is initially absent (&lt;1 ms following impact) on all surfaces. The amount of ejected droplets later during droplet spreading is determined as a function of surface structuring and temperature. Atomization ceases when the surface has cooled sufficiently (2.5–4 ms depending on the surface). The maximum amount of atomization for a given scenario is highly dependent on surface temperature and surface microstructure characteristics. At low surface temperatures, atomization increases with increasing surface temperature; however at high surface temperatures atomization decreases with increasing surface temperature. This rise and fall behavior is tantamount to the classical relationship between heat flux and surface temperature for pool boiling. Both droplet impingement and pool boiling depend on vapor bubble formation dynamics and the stability of the so-called Leidenfrost vapor film, which is impacted by surface wettability. Results also show that small surface pitch causes a high atomization intensity, indicating that not all superhydrophobic surfaces sustain Leidenfrost-like behavior at all excess temperatures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Atmospheric temperature; Atomization; Drops; Heat flux; High speed photography; Image processing; Surface properties; Droplet impingement; Image processing algorithm; Low surface temperature; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Surface microstructures; Surface structuring; Surface temperatures; Surface wettability; Hydrophobicity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048962910

Moment frame configurations offer the most architectural flexibility, but are somewhat limited by a lack of guidance in the AISC seismic provisions regarding the use of non-orthogonal (skewed) beam-column connections. A recent study investigating laterally skewed moment frame connections indicates adequate seismic performance; however, it was observed that skewed connections increase the potential for column twist and column flange yielding. It is unclear how larger column axial loads present in medium-to-high-rise structures will affect the performance of skewed special moment frame connections. This study investigates the effects of column axial loads on skewed special moment frame connections containing reduced beam sections (RBSs). Detailed finite element analyses are used for all investigations, and several beam-column connection configurations are considered, representing: 3 beam-column geometries (shallow, medium and deep columns); 4 levels of skew at the beam-to-column connection; and 4 levels of applied column axial load. Results indicate that for axial loads less than 50% of the column axial capacity, there is little effect on connection rotation capacity. Beam-skew angle is the main contributor to resulting column twist. With the exception of the deep column geometries that experienced local flange buckling at 50% ΦPn axial load, increased column axial loads have little effect on resulting column flange yielding in skewed RBS moment connections. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Flanges; Seismology; Structural frames; Beam - column connection; Beam-to-column connections; Connection rotation; High rise structures; RBS moment connection; Reduced beam section; Seismic Performance; Special moment frames; Axial loads",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053782692

To achieve the target limits of carbon dioxide emission, set by national and international policies, carbon capture will play a key role. Modeling and optimization of various carbon capture technologies such as pre-combustion, oxy-fuel, and post-combustion, when integrated with coal-fired power plants, have been researched extensively in literature. Research on the integration of power generation with capture technologies regarding comparisons between the different schemes in response to dynamic inputs is lacking. This work provides a comparison between a low temperature carbon capture and a chemical absorption process in response to a dynamic electricity demand and price profile and in the presence of an intermittent wind power supply. The objective in this work is to meet the overall electricity demand of residential users and the carbon capture process while the total operating cost associated with the integrated system of power generation and carbon capture is minimized. This comparison includes scenarios with and without energy storage associated with each capture technology. It is observed that in both integrated systems, with and without energy storage, the overall electricity demanded by the capture process and residential users is supplied by a combination of coal and wind power. For the case without energy storage, the total operating cost and energy demand of the low temperature carbon capture, based on a similar amount of captured carbon dioxide, are 4.3% and 20.5% less than that of chemical absorption, respectively. For the scenario with energy storage, the low temperature carbon capture requires 32.34% less energy to capture similar amounts of carbon dioxide while incurring 9.09% less overall operational cost. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture; Chemical absorption; Dynamic inputs; Dynamic optimization; Low temperature carbon capture; Power generation","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal storage; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Electric power utilization; Fossil fuel power plants; Global warming; Housing; Integrated control; Operating costs; Power generation; Precombustion; Wind power; Carbon capture process; Carbon dioxide emissions; Chemical absorption; Coal-fired power plant; Dynamic optimization; International policies; Low temperatures; Modeling and optimization; Temperature; absorption; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal-fired power plant; combustion; comparative study; demand analysis; electricity; energy policy; energy storage; fossil fuel; integrated approach; low temperature; optimization; performance assessment; power generation; prediction; price dynamics; wind power",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049357214

Engineers typically neglect the block-out concrete in design, effectively treating block-out connections as exposed connections with pinned behavior. Quantifying the flexural strength and stiffness of block-out connections is helpful for determining moment demands on foundations and may lead to more economical connections at the base of steel moment frames. Eight experimental specimens (two-thirds scale) were subjected to lateral loads to investigate the effects of column size, block-out thickness, and load orientation on connection flexural strength and stiffness. The observed flexural strengths were 1.4–2.7 times greater than those calculated neglecting the block-out concrete, because the block-out concrete effectively thickened and expanded the column base plate. A simple method was developed that predicted the flexural strength of the block-out connections to within 10 percent. The effective flexural stiffness at the base of the columns that were tested could be reasonably estimated using a model that combines the theory of beams on elastic foundations with a base rotational spring. © 2018",,"Columns (structural); Concretes; Stiffness; Beams on elastic foundation; Column base plate; Economical connection; Experimental specimens; Flexural stiffness; Rotational spring; Steel moment frames; Strength and stiffness; Bending strength; column; concrete; flexure; steel; stiffness; strength",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049591636

It is well known, however, that in practice there is no such thing as a universal compression algorithm; thus, some statistical information about the plaintext tends to survive the compression process. In this paper, we consider Lempel-Ziv Welch compression and analyze its effectiveness in removing statistical information from English plaintext. Specifically, we present several techniques for exploiting the structure of the compression algorithm to launch a successful statistical attack on compressed and encrypted data. All attacks are ciphertext only, and one of them relies on linear programming. Although our attacks indicate that an eavesdropper may require additional ciphertext to carry out a successful attack if compression is used, the specific adaptive nature of the Lempel-Ziv compression technique leaves its own statistics on the message, which can be exploited by an attacker. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Channel coding; Linear programming; Security of data; Signal encoding; Statistics; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adaptive natures; Compression algorithms; Compression encoding; Compression process; Compression techniques; Statistical attacks; Statistical information; Universal compression; Cryptography",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056700920

Vessel operation in water environments can be enhanced by routing algorithms that integrate mission parameters with environmental data and vessel specifications. These algorithms must update predetermined routes in a timely manner as parameters and specifications change. The US Army Engineer Research and Development Center Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory is developing the capability for military planners to rapidly optimize vessel routes in water environments by extending capabilities of the Rapid Operational Access and Maneuver Support (ROAMS) modeling platform. The ROAMS platform allows users to rapidly generate models of a water environment in limited-information conditions, utilizing the Adaptive Hydraulics and STeady-state spectral WAVE computational engines for the base two-dimensional hydrodynamics and waves, respectively. Routing capabilities are built on path search and penalty-barrier optimization to automatically produce routes that account for temporally changing environmental variables and vessel maneuverability. This work outlines the components of the ROAMS routing package and presents a case study using ROAMS in a northeastern American metropolitan area. Benefits and limitations of the ROAMS routing platform are discussed and future improvements are suggested. © The Author(s) 2018.","logistics; military logistics; Operation planning; route modeling; vessel route planning","Fighter aircraft; Hydraulics; Parameter estimation; Specifications; Changing constraints; Coastal and hydraulics laboratories; Coastal environments; Environmental variables; Military logistics; Operation planning; Route planning; Two-dimensional hydrodynamics; Logistics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046744250

First, a dynamic stiffness matrix of the flexible beam is deduced, which has the same definition and a similar form as the traditional static compliance/stiffness matrix but is frequency dependent. Second, the pseudo-static modeling procedure for the dynamic analysis is implemented in a statics-similar way based on D'alembert's principle. Then, all the kinematic, static and dynamic performances of compliant mechanisms can be analyzed based on the pseudo-static model. The superiority of the proposed method is that when it is used for the dynamic modeling of compliant mechanisms, the traditional dynamic modeling procedures, such as calculation of the elastic and kinetic energies as well as using Lagrange's equation, are avoided and the dynamic modeling is converted to a staticssimilar problem. Comparison of the proposed method with an elastic-beam-based model in previous literature and finite element analysis for an exemplary XY precision positioning stage reveals its high accuracy and easy operation. © 2018 by ASME.","Compliant mechanisms","Dynamics; Flexible structures; Frequency domain analysis; Kinetic energy; Mechanisms; Stiffness matrix; D' Alembert's principle; Dynamic stiffness matrix; Frequency dependent; Frequency domains; Lagrange's equation; Modeling procedure; Precision positioning stage; Static and dynamic performance; Compliant mechanisms",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048460195

The extent of the cavity effect is quantified using apparent absorptivity and apparent emissivity. Analysis of complicated thermal systems is simplified through application of apparent radiative properties to cavity geometries. The apparent radiative properties of a specularly-reflecting, gray, isothermal V-groove have been derived analytically, but these results have not been validated experimentally or numerically. Additionally, the model for apparent absorptivity of an infinite V-groove subjected to partial illumination in the presence of collimated irradiation is not available. In this work, the following existing models for a specularly-reflecting V-groove are collected into a single source: (1) the apparent absorptivity of a diffusely irradiated V-groove, (2) the apparent emissivity of an isothermal V-groove and (3) the apparent absorptivity of a V-groove subject to collimated irradiation with full-illumination. Further, a new analytical model is developed to predict the apparent absorptivity of an infinite V-groove subject to collimated irradiation with partial-illumination. A custom, Monte Carlo ray tracing solver is used to predict the apparent radiative properties for all cases as a means of numerical verification by comparing the ray tracing data with the results from the new model in this work and the previously existing models. For diffuse irradiation, the analytical model and ray tracing data show excellent agreement with an average discrepancy of 4.4 × 10−4, verifying the diffuse-irradiation analytical model. Similar agreement is found for collimated irradiation, where the full and partial illumination models indicate average discrepancies of 4.9 × 10−4 and 4.6 × 10−4 when compared with ray tracing data. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Angular surfaces; Cavity effect; Specular reflection; V-groove; Variable emissivity surface","Analytical models; Electromagnetic wave emission; Heat radiation; Irradiation; Isotherms; Radiation; Cavity effect; Collimated irradiation; Monte-Carlo ray tracing; Multiple reflections; Numerical verification; Radiative properties; Specular reflections; V grooves; Ray tracing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044440753

Multi-walled CNTs were initially nucleated and grown on alumina nanoparticles using a liquid precursor of ferrocene dissolved in xylene. The CNT seeds were extended using ethylene as the gas precursor. Forces generated by CNT growth separated the alumina support clusters to result in a porous entangled structure with a 60 times gain in weight and a 1300 times gain in volume, compared to the original alumina particles.

The present study first proposes an exact analytical solution for piled raft foundation subjected to harmonic excitation and resting on an elastic Winkler foundation to obtain its natural radial frequency. After successful validation through available centrifuge test results, a series of parametric study has been carried out investigating the influence of various geometrical and geotechnical parameters of the foundation and the soils respectively. It is observed that the pile length and the pile diameter has significant effect on the natural radial frequency of the foundation system whereas soil density and spacing between piles have minimal effect. The importance of stiffness of the superstructure is also considered in the proposed methodology. It is found that the natural radial frequency of piled raft foundation including superstructure stiffness decreases by 12% to 28% when compared with the computation of the natural radial frequency excluding effect of superstructure stiffness. Hence, this study provides a new analytical methodology to obtain the dynamics characteristics of piled raft foundation considering the superstructure effect which can be used for the design. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Earthquakes; Natural radial frequency; Pile; Raft; Stiffness; Superstructure","Consolidation; Earthquakes; Foundations; Stiffness; Tall buildings; Analytical methodology; Dynamic characteristics; Dynamics characteristic; Exact analytical solutions; Geotechnical parameters; Natural radial frequency; Raft; Superstructure; Piles; analytical framework; centrifugal model test; earthquake engineering; foundation; geotechnical engineering; pile; stiffness",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047252554

In literature, mesh failure mechanics have been studied with uniaxial, biaxial, and cyclic load testing of dry and wet meshes. Also, extensive experimental studies have been conducted on surrogates, such as non-human primates and rodents, to understand the effect of mesh stiffness, pore size, and knitting patterns on mesh biocompatibility. However, the mechanical properties of such animal tissue surrogates are widely different from human tissues. Therefore, to date, mechanics of the interaction between mesh and human tissues is poorly understood. This work addresses this gap in literature by experimentally and computationally modeling the biomechanical behavior of mesh, sutured to human tissue phantom under tension. A commercially available mesh (Prolene®) was sutured to vaginal tissue phantom material and tested at different uniaxial strains and strain rates. Global and local stresses at the tissue phantom, suture, and mesh were analyzed. The results of this study provide important insights into the mechanics of prosthetic mesh failure and will be indispensable for better mesh design in the future. © 2018 by the authors.","Finite element; Hernia; Pelvic organ prolapse; Prolene®; Prosthetic mesh",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079127121

In this paper, vehicle search paths are dictated by a joint cost function which maximizes the reward earned from partitioned sections across the search area. In previous work, these rewards were assigned based on the elapsed time since the section had last been searched. This approach is effective in rewarding vehicles to search out areas which haven't been visited in a long time, yet it lacks the ability to weight grid cells differently based on the probability that targets will be in that section. This paper proposes a method of using accumulated knowledge of the average density of targets within an area, along with a Gaussian process regression to assign rewards. Vehicles then choose paths that are more likely to find targets rather than seeking areas which have not been searched recently. Through numerical simulations we show that this method increases the number of targets seen by cooperating UAVs and provides an accurate estimate of target density within a search area. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Cost functions; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Numerical methods; Cooperating vehicles; Gaussian process regression; Grid cells; Mission objectives; Search area; Search parameters; Target density; Vehicle searches; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053876914

This tendency can be used to create bistable states.

One of these new methods involves researchers creating random peptides and testing their antimicrobial activity. Developing antibiotics from these peptides requires understanding which sequence motifs will be toxic to bacteria. To determine if the toxic peptides of a randomly-generated peptide library can be uniquely classified based solely on sequence motifs, we created the PepSeq Pipeline: a new software that utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to extract motifs from a peptide library. We found that this pipeline can accurately classify 56% of the toxic peptides in the peptide library using motifs extracted from the model. Testing on simulated data with less noise, we could classify up to 94% of the toxic peptides. The pipeline extracted significant toxic motifs in every library that was tested, but its ability to classify all toxic peptides depended on the number of motifs in the library. Once extracted, these motifs can be used both to understand the biology behind why certain peptides are toxic and to create novel antibiotics.

The fidelity and convergence of a given finite-dimensional Koopman approximation is a subject of ongoing research. In this paper we introduce a class of Koopman observable functions that confer an approximate closure property on their corresponding finite-dimensional approximations of the Koopman operator.

ODT has been applied to a wide range of complex multi-scale flows, such as turbulent combustion. Previous ODT comparisons to experimental data have focused mainly on planar flows. Applications to cylindrical flows, such as round jets, have been based on rough analogies, e.g., by exploiting the fortuitous consistency of the similarity scalings of temporally developing planar jets and spatially developing round jets. To obtain a more systematic treatment, a new formulation of the ODT model in cylindrical and spherical coordinates is presented here. The model is written in terms of a geometric factor so that planar, cylindrical, and spherical configurations are represented in the same way. Temporal and spatial versions of the model are presented. A Lagrangian finite-volume implementation is used with a dynamically adaptive mesh. The adaptive mesh facilitates the implementation of cylindrical and spherical versions of the triplet map, which is used to model turbulent advection (eddy events) in the one-dimensional flow coordinate. In cylindrical and spherical coordinates, geometric stretching of the three triplet map images occurs due to the radial dependence of volume, with the stretching being strongest near the centerline. Two triplet map variants, TMA and TMB, are presented. In TMA, the three map images have the same volume, but different radial segment lengths. In TMB, the three map images have the same radial segment lengths, but different segment volumes. Cylindrical results are presented for temporal pipe flow, a spatial nonreacting jet, and a spatial nonreacting jet flame. These results compare very well to direct numerical simulation for the pipe flow, and to experimental data for the jets. The nonreacting jet treatment overpredicts velocity fluctuations near the centerline, due to the geometric stretching of the triplet maps and its effect on the eddy event rate distribution. TMB performs better than TMA. A hybrid planar-TMB (PTMB) approach is also presented, which further improves the results. TMA, TMB, and PTMB are nearly identical in the pipe flow where the key dynamics occur near the wall away from the centerline. The jet flame illustrates effects of variable density and viscosity, including dilatational effects. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cylindrical; ODT; One-dimensional turbulence; Turbulence modeling","Combustion; Image segmentation; Mesh generation; Pipe flow; Spheres; Turbulence; Turbulence models; Computationally efficient; Cylindrical; One dimensional turbulence; One-dimensional turbulence model; One-dimensional turbulence modeling; Spherical configurations; Spherical coordinates; Velocity fluctuations; Fighter aircraft; advection; comparative study; cylinder; geometry; numerical model; one-dimensional modeling; pipe flow; turbulence",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048364101

These techniques can be used to reduce the requirements on CSI prior to code construction, because the codes will either adapt to the operating parameters of the legitimate user's channel on the fly and/or target a maximum allowable probability of intercept (POI) at the eavesdropper.

Understanding the fundamental physical phenomena associated with radiative transfer in these environments is thus critical to predicting the physical phenomena. This chapter seeks to present the fundamental physics of radiative transfer in high-temperature gases and review the viable methods for predicting the associated radiative transfer. The general physical statements of gas radiation are first formulated. It is shown that the principal properties of molecular gases needed for the radiative transfer equation are the gas spectral absorption cross section and the spectral absorption coefficient. Radiation constants and equations are explicitly written in terms of wavenumber for gas radiation. The fundamentals of the physical nature of gas radiation are presented to contextualize the spectral properties - what defines positions, strength, and shape of spectral lines at given temperature and pressure. The chapter provides the information needed to find and to read spectroscopic databases such as HITRAN and HITEMP and how to use the compiled data to assemble the gas absorption spectra for both the gas absorption cross section and the gas absorption coefficient. The principles of narrow band models and global models of gas radiation are formulated. The statistical narrow band model with Malkmus' distribution function of line strength for an array of Lorentz lines is presented, and its application for modeling of radiation transfer in nonuniform media is explained. The wide range of global models of gas radiation starting from gray model and weightedsum- of-gray-gases model and their development into more advanced models such as SLW, ADF, and FSK is described. While more detailed attention is given to the SLW model, its relation to the FSK and ADF models is outlined. Finally, the application of global models for prediction of radiative transfer in nonuniform gaseous medium is presented. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

These results reveal participation differences between schools based upon demographics and provides a basis for conducting future large-scale work on publicly available artifacts, such as school tweets, that may be meaningfully used as education research data. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","schools; Social media; Twitter",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050976491

The system embeds the CMOS image sensor directly in a PDMS layer instead of the standard chip package to support microfluidic structures much larger and more complex than those in prior art. The CMOS/PDMS layer is self-aligned to form a continuous, flat surface to provide structural support for upper microfluidic layers. The system consists of five layers of PDMS implementing fluid channels, valves, chambers, and inlets/outlets. A custom CMOS image sensor with integrated signal conditioning circuits directly captures light from sample fluid for high optical collection efficiency. Owing to the flexibility afforded by the integration process, the system demonstrates, for the first time, integrated valves in contact imaging. Moreover, we present the first direct comparison of the optical performance of a CMOS image sensor and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) in identical contact-imaging conditions. Measurements show that our CMOS sensor achieves 17 dB better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with a commercial PMT across a broad range of integration times, with a maximum SNR of 47 dB. Chemiluminescent testing successfully shows signal detection for different analyte concentrations and integration times.

Named equations tested include the Meyer-Peter Muller, Barry, Pagosa good condition, Wilcock, Parker (both calibrated and uncalibrated), Recking, and that of Elhakeem and Imran. The purpose of the tests was to evaluate the performance of several empirical and semiempirical formulae using a single calibration point relative to three uncalibrated equations. The seven equations were included because they either have a calibration procedure already developed, are used frequently in practice, are historically foundational in the field, or have recently been proposed. Results are expressed in the root mean square error of the logarithms (RMSEL) and the relative mean error (RME) and show that the Pagosa good and Barry equations best predict bedload sediment transport (RMSEL of 0.02 and 0.02, respectively). The Pagosa good equation requires a data point for bankfull discharge and the corresponding bedload transport. The uncalibrated Recking (2013) equation resulted in lower errors than two of the calibrated formulae (Wilcock 2001 and Parker 1990) and was not far behind the calibrated Elhakeem and Imran (2016) formula. The Meyer-Peter Muller and uncalibrated Parker (1990) equations performed the worst (RMSEL of up to 0.85 and 0.86, respectively). The results herein demonstrate: (1) empirical formulae were more successful at predicting bedload transport than semiempirical alternatives, (2) a single calibration point significantly improves the predictive accuracy of any formula, and (3) calibration cannot compensate for all the shortcomings of a model. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Calibration; Errors; Forecasting; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Stream flow; Bankfull discharge; Bed-load transport rate; Bedload sediment transport; Calibration procedure; Gravel-bed streams; Predictive accuracy; Root mean square errors; Semi-empirical methods; Mean square error; bedload; calibration; comparative study; empirical analysis; gravel bed stream; prediction; sediment transport",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046279262

Purpose/Hypothesis: The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of how students respond, via engagement, to their engineering design activities during class. This study hypothesizes that students would experience no self-reported mean changes in topic emotions from their preassessment scores for each engineering design topic and instructional format nor would electrodermal activities (EDA) associate to these topic emotions throughout the design activities. Design/Method: Eighty-eight freshmen engineering students completed online pretopic and posttopic emotions surveys for five engineering design activities. A subset of 14–18 participants, the focal point of this study, wore an EDA sensor while completing the surveys and participating in these sessions. Results: Preliminary findings suggest that EDA increased for individual and collaborative active learning activities compared to lectures. No significant changes in EDA were found between individual and collaborative active learning activities. Moderate negative correlations were found between EDA and negative topic emotions in the first engineering design activity but not across the rest. At the end of the semester, active learning activities showed higher effect sizes indicating a re-enforcement of students' engagement in the engineering design method activities. Conclusion: This study provides initial results showing how multimodal approaches can help researchers understand students' closer-to-real-time engagement in engineering design topics and instructional delivery formats. © 2018 ASEE","affective theories; design projects; electrodermal activity; learning environment; multimodal methods","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Design; Electrodes; Fusion reactions; Plasma theory; Students; Surveys; affective theories; Design projects; Electrodermal activity; Learning environments; Multi-modal; Engineering education",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051166233

In this paper, a kinetostatic modeling method for flexure-hinge-based compliant mechanisms with hybrid serial-parallel substructures is presented to provide accurate and concise solutions by combining the matrix displacement method with the transfer matrix method. The transition between the elemental stiffness matrix and the transfer matrix of flexure hinges/flexible beams is straightforward, enabling the condensation of a hybrid serial-parallel substructure into one equivalent two-node element simple. A general kinetostatic model of the whole compliant mechanisms is first established based on the equilibrium equation of the nodal force. Then, a condensed two-port mechanical network representing the input/output force-displacement relations of single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) compliant mechanisms and the Jacobian matrix for multi-DOF compliant mechanisms are respectively built. Comparison of the proposed method with the compliance matrix method in previous literature, finite element analysis and experiment for three exemplary mechanisms reveals good prediction accuracy, suggesting its feasibility for fast performance evaluation and parameter optimization at the initial stage of design. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Compliant mechanisms; Flexible manipulator; Flexure hinge; Transfer matrix method","Complex networks; Compliant mechanisms; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Finite element method; Flexible manipulators; Hinges; Jacobian matrices; Mechanisms; Stiffness matrix; Distributed compliances; Flexure hinge; Force-displacement relations; Kinetostatic analysis; Matrix displacement method; Parameter optimization; Performance evaluations; Single degree of freedoms; Transfer matrix method",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044987554

A major shortcoming of most commercially available 3D printers is that their resolution is not sufficient to produce features that are truly microfluidic (&lt; 100 × 100 μm2). Here, we test a custom 3D printer for making ~30 μm scale positive and negative surface features, as well as positive and negative features within internal voids (i.e., microfluidic channels). We found that optical dosage control is essential for creating the smallest microfluidic features (~30 μm wide for ridges, ~20 μm wide for trenches), and that this resolution was achieved for a number of different exposure approaches. Additionally, we printed various microfluidic particle traps, showed capture of 25 μm diameter polymer beads, and iteratively improved the trap design. The rapid feedback allowed by 3D printing, as well as the ability to carefully control optical exposure conditions, should lead to new innovations in the types and sizes of devices that can be created for microfluidics. © 2018 by the authors.","3D printing; Microfluidics; Particle traps; Stereolithography","3D printers; Fluidic devices; Printing presses; Stereolithography; 3-D printing; Exposure conditions; Micro-fluidic devices; Microfluidic channel; Particle traps; Rapid feedback; Surface feature; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; Microfluidics",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049640252

The research model involved giving the students a construction interest inventory and career placement inventory pre-and post-participation in an after-school 3D modeling construction centric curriculum. The curriculum introduced students to the construction fields by giving the students weekly snapshots into construction careers, and also required the students to learn about floor and elevation plans. Students were then taught and expected to design a 3D computer model of a home using Minecraft and Sketchup. The students were provided 4 different models to choose from.

A combination of visual art and innovative engineering offers an unusual opportunity to engage a wide spectrum of society. To evaluate the potential, faculty and students collaborated with the Brigham Young University Museum of Art to create a museum exhibition that connected the art of origami to engineering, math, science, and product design. A framework is introduced that includes the creation of a museum exhibition; and once the initial investment is made to create the central exhibition, the results are efficiently used to extend outreach efforts through first-generation products (coincident with the exhibition) and then through second-generation products (after the exhibition). The paper describes a detailed example of this framework and provides evidence to support the concept that displaying research artifacts in an art museum can expand research opportunities. Products from the exhibition that provided expanded outreach opportunities include the following: an exhibit catalog originally created for the gift shop that was expanded for publication with a national publisher; a tablet/smart phone app that includes origami instructions followed by related engineering activities, which has had broad use beyond the museum activity room; a video that was prepared for museum patrons but has since been made available to larger audiences; materials created for hands-on museum activities that were used for outreach activities after the exhibition; and leverage for industry visits that led to additional applications and research projects. This paper describes the museum exhibition, the first- and second-generation products, the impact of each product, and the benefits and pitfalls of using a museum exhibition to extend outreach impact. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",,,Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051223119

Many college courses have a familiar format: students listen to lectures, read textbooks, complete assignments, and demonstrate their learning through exams. Often, the instructor will structure the course for convenience, perhaps creating highly structured PowerPoint presentations and using standardized multiple choice exams to easily grade performance. Students, on the other hand, then structure their learning practices to match - trying to determine exactly how much to come to class, read, and memorize, with the end goal of regurgitating information on the exam and getting a satisfactory grade in the course. These practices are not conducive to long-term retention and application by the students, nor to accurate assessment or facilitation of learning by the instructor. But unless both the instructor and the students in a course understand and are amenable to alternative techniques, the format is unlikely to change. There has been extensive research on techniques aimed to increase student engagement in the classroom, such as ""flipping the classroom"" and identifying and overcoming the ""illusion of learning."" This paper describes the efforts of the author over three semesters to incorporate these tools into a senior-level course on manufacturing system design and lean manufacturing to help facilitate better learning and assess proficiency more effectively. Several techniques are used, including suggestions from the recent book Make It Stick by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel.

Concerns also persist about the moral and ethical commitments of engineers once they enter the workplace, as underscored by a number of recent ethics scandals involving engineers and technology. The education of ethically adept engineers therefore remains a pertinent issue for the engineering education community. Yet there remains relatively little research on how students' prior experiences shape their ethical perspectives. Specifically, there is a lack of understanding of the role of pre-college and early college experiences and other influences in shaping first-year engineering students' views on ethics. This paper reports select results from an NSF-funded project aiming to address some of these gaps in the literature. This longitudinal study was conducted across four universities and focused on the ethical development of undergraduate engineering students. Preliminary analysis of interviews from the first phase of this study identified a number of major themes in the data set, two of which are important to highlight here: 1) influences on students' ethical perspectives (e.g., academic curricular, extracurricular activities, family, etc.) and 2) learned outcomes, defined as insights, learning, or realizations related to ethics, morality, and values. Deeper investigation of the relationship between specific influences and students' insights related to ethics can provide a better understanding of first-year engineering students' baseline ethical development. The goal of this paper is to characterize what specific ethical lessons are gained through various types of experiences, as well as to glean how this learning and growth occurs. Data for this study was drawn from 66 interview transcripts and consisted of sections coded simultaneously for influences and learned outcomes. The cross-coded data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. The types of influences impacting students' ethical learning, and exemplars of how students report their lived experiences and ethical realizations, are discussed through the lens of what they learned and the mechanisms through which they gained these understandings. Our analysis suggests that several pre-college (e.g., extracurricular activities, service/volunteer roles and social experiences) and early college experiences (e.g., academic courses, part-time employment) play a critical role in shaping students' ethical perspectives. We more specifically present our findings organized around eight types of experiences and influences, which are in turn related to three categories of learned outcomes and three types of learning mechanisms. As we discuss in more detail below, the results of this study will likely be of interest to engineering educators, policymakers, and researchers with an interest in administering and studying high-impact ethics interventions for undergraduate engineering students. More specifically, our results underscore the importance of being more aware of how students' background perspectives and experiences likely play important roles in enabling or disabling their further ethical development. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",,,Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051230130

Recent work has extended the crystallographic reconstruction of parent austenite in steels to include the reconstruction of special boundaries, such as annealing twins. These reconstructions present unique challenges, as twinned austenite grains share a subset of possible daughter variant orientations. This gives rise to regions of ambiguity in a reconstruction. A technique for the reconstruction of twin boundaries is presented here that is capable of reconstructing 60° <1 1 1> twins, even in the case where twin regions are comprised entirely of variants that are common between the twin and the parent. This technique is demonstrated in the reconstruction of lath martensitic steels. The reconstruction method utilizes a delayed decision-making approach, where a chosen orientation relationship is used to define all possible groupings of daughter grains into possible parents before divisive decisions are made. These overlapping, inclusive groupings (called clusters) are compared to each other individually using their calculated parent austenite orientations and the topographical nature of the overlapping region. These comparisons are used to uncover possible locations of twin boundaries present in the parent austenite. This technique can be applied to future studies on the dependence of post-transformation microstructures on the special grain boundary content of parent microstructures. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Interpreting the well-known B̄ projection in two different ways we develop two formulations for locking problems in beams and nearly incompressible elastic solids. One formulation leads to a sparse symmetric system and the other leads to a sparse non-symmetric system. To demonstrate the utility of Bézier projection for both geometry and material locking phenomena we focus on transverse shear locking in Timoshenko beams and volumetric locking in nearly compressible linear elasticity although the approach can be applied generally to other types of locking phenomena as well. Bézier projection is a local projection technique with optimal approximation properties, which in many cases produces solutions that are comparable to global L2 projection. In the context of B̄ methods, the use of Bézier projection produces sparse stiffness matrices with only a slight increase in bandwidth when compared to standard displacement-based methods. Of particular importance is that the approach is applicable to any spline representation that can be written in Bézier form like NURBS, T-splines, LR-splines, etc. We discuss in detail how to integrate this approach into an existing finite element framework with minimal disruption through the use of Bézier extraction operators and a newly introduced dual basis for the Bézier projection operator. We then demonstrate the behavior of the two proposed formulations through several challenging benchmark problems. © 2018","Bézier dual basis; Bézier extraction; Bézier projection; B̄-projection; Isogeometric analysis; Locking","Extraction; Finite element method; Geometry; Incompressible flow; Stiffness matrix; Displacement-based method; Dual basis; Isogeometric analysis; Locking; Nearly incompressible; Optimal approximation; Sparse non-symmetric systems; Spline representation; Locks (fasteners)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044050955

This development is a critical component for enabling fixed-wing aircraft to use a novel methodology called relative navigation. Relative navigation allows a single vehicle to gracefully accommodate intermittent GPS or geo-registered image updates. It can also enable communication and a computationally feasible cooperative, batch-based navigation approach for numerous vehicles. This paper presents a visual-odometry estimator that is appropriate for fixed-wing flight characteristics and sensing requirements. We propose a modification to the multi-state-constraint Kalman filter which, instead of running the filter in a single inertial/global frame, regularly resets the navigation frame to a new local origin. The vehicle operates based on the most recent keyframe and produces a marginalized change in pose (odometry) and covariance output whenever the keyframe is updated. This allows the front end to operate at the IMU rate to accommodate guidance and control inputs while sharing marginalized keyframe-to-keyframe odometry estimates with a back-end, graph optimization at a much lower rate than traditional batch navigation schemes.

When water that is saturated with air is used as the working liquid, the non-wetted cavities on the superhydrophobic surfaces act as nucleation sites and allow air to effervesce out of the water and onto the surface when heated. Previous works in the literature have only considered the opposite case where the water is undersaturated and absorbs air out the cavities for a microchannel setting. The microchannel considered in this work consists of a rib/cavity structured superhydrophobic surface and a glass surface separated by spacers. The microchannel is 60 mm long by 14 mm wide and two channel heights of nominally 183 μm and 366 μm are explored. The superhydrophobic side is in contact with a heated aluminum block and a camera is used to visualize the flow through the glass side. Thermocouples are embedded in the aluminum to record the temperature profile along the length of the channel. Temperatures are maintained below the boiling temperature of the working liquid. The friction factor-Reynolds product (fRe) is obtained via pressure drop and volumetric flow-rate measurements. Five surface types/configurations are investigated: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with ribs perpendicular to the flow, superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow, and superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow with several breaker ridges perpendicular to the flow. The surface type/configuration has a significant impact on the mass transport dynamics. For surfaces with closed cell micro-structures, large bubbles eventually form and adversely affect fRe and lead to higher temperatures along the channel. When degassed water is used, no bubble nucleation is observed and the air initially trapped in the superhydrophobic cavities is quickly absorbed by the water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Convection; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Microchannel; Nucleation; Superhydrophobic","Aluminum; Aspect ratio; Flow rate; Glass; Heat convection; Heat transfer; Laminar flow; Mass transfer; Microchannels; Nucleation; Surface properties; Thermocouples; Boiling temperature; Bubble nucleation; High aspect ratio; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Superhydrophobic; Temperature profiles; Transport dynamics; Volumetric flow rate; Hydrophobicity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039982303

Delivery methods have been shown to significantly impact project cost and schedule. As the use of alternative project delivery methods increases, the perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages to using a particular method have matured. This paper reports on a national study of over 80 transportation owners and designers to measure their perceptions of the three most widely used delivery methods: design bid build (DBB), construction manager at risk (CMAR), and design build (DB). The study develops a list of factors that influence the selection of a delivery method, and then tests the most significant factors that lead to the selection of each individual method. Analyses using Fisher's least significant difference intervals and multiple range tests allow for the identification of specific correlations between the delivery method and motivating factors or project goals. The analyses show that delivery method selection is motivated primarily by project urgency, cost, and risk allocation. For the three main delivery methods of DBB, CMAR, and DB, motivation for their selection is primarily based on cost, risk allocation, and project urgency, respectively. User perceptions align with findings from literature in terms of schedule performance, but do not align in terms of cost performance. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by reporting on the most current motivating factors for the selection and use of the most popular delivery methods. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Costs; Motivation; Project management; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Alternative project delivery methods; Body of knowledge; Construction manager; Least significant differences; Project delivery method; Schedule performance; Transportation projects; User perceptions; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044584100

Flexural compression strength is usually greater than axial compression strength, and a reasonable experimental data set supports this assertion. However, little information exists for high-strength concrete block masonry subjected to combined axial and flexural loadings. This paper presents axial and flexural compression strengths and deformation properties of high-strength concrete block masonry. Seventy-two masonry prisms were constructed and tested to evaluate the capacity and behavior of high-strength structural masonry subject to compressive concentric and eccentric loading; both grouted and hollow prisms were used. Block strengths of 44, 56, and 67 MPa are considered. The results show an increase of flexural compression strength of 15-29% for the hollow prisms and of 70-79% for the grouted prisms compared with their axial compression strength. Measured ultimate strain varies from 0.14 to 0.19% for the axial compression and from 0.20 to 0.25% for the flexural compression. Hollow prism strength varies from 52 to 62% of the block strength, whereas grouted prism strength varies from 43 to 59% of the block strength. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Concentric and eccentric loading; High-strength concrete masonry block; Hollow and grouted prisms","Axial compression; Concrete construction; Grouting; High performance concrete; Mortar; Prisms; Retaining walls; Stress analysis; Walls (structural partitions); Axial compressive load; Compression strength; Deformation properties; Eccentric loading; Flexural compression; High strength concretes; Out of plane loads; Out-of-plane bending; Compressive strength",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044731763

As a low power consumption device, the proposed tool has simple structure, and is easy to use. The strain gauge is attached to the back of the user to acquire sitting data. A three-layer BP neural network is employed to distinguish normal sitting posture, slight hunchback and severe hunchback according to the acquired data. Experimental results show that our method is both realizable and effective, achieving 98.75% posture identification accuracy.

Pollutants often accumulate to unhealthy concentrations during winter inversion events like those that commonly occur in the state of Utah and other mountainous regions. Electric vehicles (EV) are a potential solution to reduce harmful tail-pipe emissions that accumulate during inversions. This work represents a systems-level analysis of the degree to which replacing internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE) with EVs would reduce the near-road accumulation of criteria pollutants. The analysis draws on vehicle miles travelled data from major highways in Utah, vehicle fuel efficiency data, EPA-specified vehicle pollution emission standards, and local weather pattern trends. It employs two models, built in MATLAB and the agent-based modeling environment NetLogo, to determine pollutant concentrations, accumulation, and dispersion rates. These results are processed to determine changes in the Air Quality Index (AQI) caused by adjusting the percentage of EVs present within the vehicle population. The analysis concludes that replacing a significant percentage (80-100%) of the existing, fossil-fuel powered vehicle population with EVs would improve local AQI by 13 points. During extreme inversion events in Utah, these reductions would delay AQI levels from reaching 'red,' or unhealthy, status for enough time to allow local weather patterns to shift and dissipate the inversion event and accompanying pollution. Such a drastic reduction in AQI translates into better adolescent and elderly health and could minimize the risk of early onset asthma and other respiratory illnesses in regions negatively affected by high traffic pollution and winter inversion events. © 2018 IEEE.","Criteria pollutants; Electric vehicles; Environmental impact; Inversion; Modeling and simulation",,Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048854895

While most individuals recover fully from mild injuries within weeks, some continue to experience symptoms including headaches, disrupted sleep, and other cognitive, behavioral or physical symptoms. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) shows promise in identifying areas of structural disruption and predicting outcomes. Although some studies suggest widespread structural disruption after brain injury, dMRI studies of military brain injury have yielded mixed results so far, perhaps due to the subtlety of mild injury, individual differences in injury location, severity and mechanism, and co-morbidity with other disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance abuse. We present preliminary dMRI results from the ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) military brain injury working group. We found higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in participants with a history of TBI. Understanding the injury and recovery process, along with factors that influence these, will lead to improved diagnosis and treatment. © 2018 IEEE.","Blast; Diffusion MRI; ENIGMA; Military; Traumatic brain injury","Blasting; Brain; Diffusion; Diseases; Neuroimaging; Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; Diffusion mris; ENIGMA; Individual Differences; Military; Neuroimaging genetics; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Traumatic Brain Injuries; Magnetic resonance imaging",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048095124

The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of forefoot strike (FFS) and rearfoot strike (RFS) running patterns on foot kinematics and kinetics, from the perspectives of the midtarsal locking theory and the windlass mechanism. Per the midtarsal locking theory, we hypothesized that the ankle would be more inverted in early stance when using a FFS, resulting in decreased midtarsal joint excursions and increased dynamic stiffness. Associated with a more engaged windlass mechanism, we hypothesized that a FFS would elicit increased metatarsophalangeal joint excursions and negative work in late stance. Eighteen healthy female runners ran overground with both FFS and RFS patterns. Instrumented motion capture and a validated multi-segment foot model were used to analyze midtarsal and metatarsophalangeal joint kinematics and kinetics. During early stance in FFS the ankle was more inverted, with concurrently decreased midtarsal eversion (p < 0.001) and abduction excursions (p = 0.003) but increased dorsiflexion excursion (p = 0.005). Dynamic midtarsal stiffness did not differ (p = 0.761). During late stance in FFS, metatarsophalangeal extension was increased (p = 0.009), with concurrently increased negative work (p < 0.001). In addition, there was simultaneously increased midtarsal positive work (p < 0.001), suggesting enhanced power transfer in FFS. Clear evidence for the presence of midtarsal locking was not observed in either strike pattern during running. However, the windlass mechanism appeared to be engaged to a greater extent during FFS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Forefoot strike; Metatarsophalangeal joint; Midfoot; Multi-segment foot; Rearfoot strike","Energy transfer; Joints (anatomy); Kinematics; Kinetics; Stiffness; Windlasses; Forefoot strike; Metatarsophalangeal joints; Mid-foot; Multi-segment foot; Rearfoot; Locks (fasteners); adult; Article; female; forefoot strike; gait; human; human experiment; kinematics; kinetics; metatarsophalangeal joint; midtarsal locking; normal human; priority journal; rearfoot strike; rigidity; running strike pattern; windlass mechanism; biomechanics; foot joint; physiology; running; young adult; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Foot Joints; Humans; Kinetics; Running; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045559964

Fiber optic sensors are known for their ability to survive in harsh environments such as high pressure and temperature like those within oil/gas wells, or high vibration like those with electromagnetic railguns. As these sensors become commercially available, one challenge is overcoming multiple noise sources simultaneously in the sensor and its network imposed from the harsh environment. Optical amplifiers are typically used in fiber optic sensors to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This method is suitable for boosting the signal above the floor caused by electrical noise. However, certain noise sources in fiber optic sensors directly modulate the optical signal. This can be due to other measurands being induced on the system. For example, while a slab coupled optical sensor (SCOS) is sensitive to electric field, it is also inherently sensitive to strain; therefore, any strain noise imposed on the sensor would overwhelm the electric field measurement and be considered noise. In this chapter, optical phase induced interference noise (PIIN) in a sensor network is reduced by using optical phase modulation in both a SCOS and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG). Strain induced noise on the optical fiber sensor is reduced using a differential sensor setup called a push-pull SCOS. Phase modulation and differentiation are then combined to allow for simultaneous noise reduction from different noise sources and allow for optical sensing of electric fields in harsh environments. These principles are applicable to other types of fiber optic sensors and sensors in general. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Fiber optic sensors; Noise reduction; Phase modulation","Electric field measurement; Electric fields; Fiber amplifiers; Fiber Bragg gratings; Fiber optics; Fibers; Noise abatement; Optical signal processing; Phase modulation; Rail guns; Sensor networks; Signal to noise ratio; Differential sensors; Electromagnetic rail guns; High-pressure and temperatures; Interference noise; Multiple noise sources; Noise reduction technique; Optical phase modulation; Test and evaluation; Fiber optic sensors",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058093445

The ability to interact meaningfully with 3D computer-aided engineering models in these VR design reviews is an important, though often neglected, capability due to the difficulty of performing data translation between native computer-aided design (CAD) data and VR compatible file formats. A bi-directional interface was developed between a VR design review environment and a commercial CAD package that streamlines the data translation process. Transmitting both geometric data and selected metadata from the CAD system enabled the development of enhanced model interaction tools in a VR design review application. User experiments were performed that compared the enhanced tools developed to a baseline toolset. Participants success using these toolsets was measured as they performed tasks related to design understanding and decision making, such as counting the number of gears in a gearbox or evaluating the feasibility of a proposed design change in a four-cylinder engine. The analysis of the data from these experiments showed a statistically significant improvement in participants ability to understand the geometry of the model correctly, confidently, and quickly, as well as in participants ability to correctly and confidently understand the implications of a proposed design change when using the Enhanced Toolset. We conclude that the bi-directional interface concept developed in this work can be extended to enable advanced interaction with a diversity of engineering data in VR. © 2017, Springer-Verlag France.","CAD; Computer-aided engineering model interaction; Data translation; Virtual reality","Computer aided engineering; Computer aided language translation; Decision making; Engine cylinders; Machine design; Virtual reality; Data translations; Design understanding; Engineering data; Engineering design; Engineering models; Four cylinder engine; Model interaction; User experiments; Computer aided design",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020529341

It is based on Bézier extraction and projection and is applicable to any spline space which can be represented in Bézier form (i.e., NURBS, T-splines, LR-splines, etc.). The approach weakly enforces the continuity of the solution at patch interfaces and the error can be adaptively controlled by leveraging the refineability of the underlying slave dual spline basis without introducing any additional degrees of freedom. As a consequence, optimal higher-order convergence rates can be achieved without the need for an expensive shared master/slave segmentation step. We also develop weakly continuous geometry as a particular application of isogeometric Bézier dual mortaring. Weakly continuous geometry is a geometry description where the weak continuity constraints are built into properly modified Bézier extraction operators. As a result, multi-patch models can be processed in a solver directly without having to employ a mortaring solution strategy. We demonstrate the utility of the approach on several challenging benchmark problems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bézier extraction; Bézier projection; Isogeometric analysis; Mortar methods","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Extraction; Geometry; Mortar; Bench-mark problems; Convergence rates; Isogeometric analysis; Mortar methods; Patch models; Solution strategy; Spline space; Weak continuity; Interpolation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042178100

Actual data from Storm Irene (2011), the October Nor'easter (2011) and Hurricane Sandy (2012) within the Eversource Energy-Connecticut service territory were used to calibrate and test the methods; data used included predicted outages, the peak number of customers affected, a ratio of how many outages a restoration crew can repair per day, and the count of crews working per day. Data known before a storm strikes (such as predicted outages and available crews) can be used to calculate ETR and support pre-storm allocation of crews and resources, while data available immediately after the storm passes (such as customers affected) can be used as motivation for securing or releasing crews to complete the restoration in a timely manner. Used together, the methods presented in this paper will help utilities provide a reasonable, data-driven ETR without relying solely on qualitative past experiences or instinct. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","electric reliability; ETR; outage; restoration; severe weather",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041416388

Interactions between the flexible polymer matrix and conductive particles dispersed throughout it produce a voltage signal under dynamic strain, which correlates to the magnitude of impact. Though promising in applications requiring both impact sensing and energy absorption, NCF's voltage response has been observed to suffer from significant signal drift. This paper investigates several causes of variance in the response of NCF sensors to consistent impacts. These effects can be classified into three general types: recoverable transient effects (such as those relating to viscoelasticity or capacitive charging), environmental drift (due to humidity and temperature), and permanent signal decay from material degradation. The motivation for the study arises from various potential repeat-impact applications where periodic recalibration of the sensor would be difficult (such as a gait-tracking insole in use for a marathon event). A cyclic drop testing machine was used to apply consistent impacts to NCF, and drift resulting from each factor (in ranges typical of an insole environment) was experimentally isolated. Models representing each factor's contribution to signal drift are presented. Of the factors investigated, humidity and temperature caused the most significant drift, with permanent material degradation accounting for only minor decay in voltage response. Transient effects were also observed, with a characteristic 'warm-up' (or 'charging') time required for the NCF to achieve steady-state; this phenomenon, and the related 'recovery' time for the material to return to its original state, were determined. The resultant data can be leveraged to implement a correction algorithm or other drift-compensating method to retain an NCF sensor's accuracy in both long and short data collection scenarios. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","foam; impact; multifunctional; nanocomposite; self-sensing; signal drift","Nanocomposites; Testing; Correction algorithms; Humidity and temperatures; impact; Material degradation; Multi-functional materials; multifunctional; Self-sensing; Signal drift; Foams",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046668283

In particular, Evans-function computation allows one to locate any unstable eigenvalues of the linear operator (if they exist); this allows one to establish spectral stability of a given wave and identify bifurcation points (loss of stability) as model parameters vary.

This is due to their low inertia and inherent ability to more safely interact with the world without damaging themselves or the people around them. However, existing sensing for soft robots has at least partially limited their ability to control interactions with their environment. Tactile sensors could enable soft robots to sense interaction, but most tactile sensors are made from rigid substrates and are not well suited to applications for soft robots which can deform. In addition, the benefit of being able to cheaply manufacture soft robots may be lost if the tactile sensors that cover them are expensive and their resolution does not scale well for manufacturability. This paper discusses the development of a method to make affordable, high-resolution, tactile sensor arrays (manufactured in rows and columns) that can be used for sensorizing soft robots and other soft bodies. However, the construction results in a sensor array that exhibits significant amounts of cross-talk when two taxels in the same row are compressed. Using the same fabric-based tactile sensor array construction design, two different methods for cross-talk compensation are presented. The first uses a mathematical model to calculate a change in resistance of each taxel directly. The second method introduces additional simple circuit components that enable us to isolate each taxel electrically and relate voltage to force directly. Fabric sensor arrays are demonstrated for two different soft-bodied applications: an inflatable single link robot and a human wrist. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","cross-talk; flexible tactile sensor array; scalable; soft body sensing; soft robot","Crosstalk; Construction design; Flexible tactile sensors; Manufacturability; Rigid substrates; scalable; Soft robot; Soft-bodies; Tactile sensor array; Robots",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045907873

Today's highly complex designs require modern software tools and the realities of a global economy often constrain engineers to remote collaboration. These conditions make it highly impractical to collaborate locally around physical models. Various approaches to creating new collaboration tools and software, which alleviate these issues, have been tried previously. However, past solutions either used expensive hardware, which is not widely available, or used standard two-dimensional (2D) monitors to share three-dimensional (3D) information. Recently, new low-cost virtual reality (VR) hardware has been introduced, which creates a highly immersive 3D experience at a tiny fraction of the cost of previous hardware.

Currently, there is no standard method for measuring the social impact of these types of products. As a result, engineers have used their own metrics, if at all. Some of the common metrics used include products sold and revenue, which measure the financial success of a product without recognizing the social successes or failures it might have. In this paper, we introduce a potential universal metric, the product impact metric (PIM), which quantifies the impact a product has on impoverished individuals - especially those living in developing countries. It measures social impact broadly in five dimensions: health, education, standard of living, employment quality, and security. By measuring impact multidimensionally, it captures impacts both anticipated and unanticipated, thereby providing a broader assessment of the product's total impact than with other more specific metrics. The PIM is calculated based on 18 simple field measurements of the consumer. It is inspired by the UN's Multidimensional Poverty Index (UNMPI) created by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The UNMPI measures how level of poverty within a nation changes year after year, and the PIM measures how an individual's poverty level changes after being affected by an engineered product. The PIM can be used to measure social impact (using specific data from products introduced into the market) or predict social impact (using personas that represent real individuals).

To accommodate the local traffic needs of high accessibility and efficiency, an increased number of signalized intersections and accesses have been installed. However, the absence of a defined hierarchical road network, together with irregular signal spacing and access density, tends to deteriorate arterial safety. Previous studies on arterial safety were generally based on a single type of road entity, either intersection or roadway segment, and they analyzed the safety contributing factors (e.g. signal density and access density) on only that type of road entity, while these suburban arterial characteristics could significantly influence the safety performance of both intersections and roadway segments. Macro-level safety modeling was usually applied to investigate the relationships between zonal crash frequencies and demographics, road network features, and traffic characteristics, but the previous researchers did not consider the specific arterial characteristics of signal density and access density. In this study, a new modeling strategy was proposed to analyze the safety impacts of zonal roadway network features (i.e., road network patterns and road network density) along with the suburban arterial characteristics of signal density and access density. Bayesian Conditional Autoregressive Poisson Log-normal models were developed for suburban arterials in 173 traffic analysis zones in the suburban area of Shanghai. Results identified that the grid pattern road network with collector roads parallel to arterials was associated with fewer crashes than networks without parallel collectors. On the other hand, lower road network density, higher signal density and higher access density tended to increase the crash occurrence on suburban arterials. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Access density; Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model; Macro level safety modeling; Road network patterns; Signal density; Suburban arterials","Land use; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Traffic signals; Conditional autoregressive; Road network; Safety modeling; Signal density; Suburban arterials; Transportation; Bayes theorem; China; city; environmental planning; human; prevention and control; safety; statistical model; suburban population; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Bayes Theorem; China; Cities; Environment Design; Humans; Models, Statistical; Safety; Suburban Population",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041471694

Because crystallographic texture is a universal characteristic of polycrystalline materials, this work has the potential to significantly expand the class of materials whose grain boundary networks can be controlled. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by application to a concrete design problem involving competing design objectives for yield strength, elastic compliance, and resistance to electromigration.

Little is known about the influence of the Coanda effect on wildland fire behavior. Specifically, there is a lack of knowledge regarding how the flame attachment on slopes influences firefighter safety zone considerations in rugged terrain. This paper presents results for small-scale n-heptane pool fire experiments near a slope, showing how flame shape and heat flux are influenced by slope angle, slope boundary condition and distance from flame base. Flames near slopes leaned toward the slope, and at some slope angles the flames attached to the slope. The average angle at which the effects of slope were noticeable was between 10° and 45°, depending on the criteria used. No difference was observed between a bare slope and an insulated slope. Dimensional analysis showed that important characteristics of flame attachment on slopes in the small-scale experiments were in the range estimated for the large fires. The implication is that the traditional view of safe separation distance as being the distance from the flame base is inadequate for fires near slopes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coanda effect; Firefighter safety; Flame attachment on slopes; Safe separation distance","Fire extinguishers; Fire fighting equipment; Fire protection; Fires; Heptane; Ambient fluids; Coanda effects; Dimensional analysis; Flame attachment on slopes; Quiescent fluid; Rugged terrain; Separation distances; Small-scale experiment; Heat flux",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041428656

For such small chips, an interconnection method is needed to provide the necessary world-to-chip reagent and pneumatic connections. In this paper, we introduce simple integrated microgaskets (SIMs) and controlled-compression integrated microgaskets (CCIMs) to connect a small device chip to a larger interface chip that implements world-to-chip connections. SIMs or CCIMs are directly 3D printed as part of the device chip, and therefore no additional materials or components are required to make the connection to the larger 3D printed interface chip. We demonstrate 121 chip-to-chip interconnections in an 11 × 11 array for both SIMs and CCIMs with an areal density of 53 interconnections per mm2 and show that they withstand fluid pressures of 50 psi. We further demonstrate their reusability by testing the devices 100 times without seal failure. Scaling experiments show that 20 × 20 interconnection arrays are feasible and that the CCIM areal density can be increased to 88 interconnections per mm2. We then show the utility of spatially distributed discrete CCIMs by using an interconnection chip with 28 chip-to-world interconnects to test 45 3D printed valves in a 9 × 5 array. Each valve is only 300 μm in diameter (the smallest yet reported for 3D printed valves). Every row of 5 valves is tested to at least 10000 actuations, with one row tested to 1-000000 actuations. In all cases, there is no sign of valve failure, and the CCIM interconnections prove an effective means of using a single interface chip to test a series of valve array chips. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Article; density; microfluidics; miniaturization; pressure; priority journal; surface property; three dimensional printing; devices; equipment design; microfluidic analysis; Equipment Design; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Printing, Three-Dimensional",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042133621

We use this simulation method as a novel tool to evaluate the locational impact of PEGylation. Using this screen, we also evaluated the predictive impact of PEGylation site solvent accessibility, conjugation site structure, PEG size, and double PEGylation.

Recent work has presented in-system debug frameworks where instrumentation added to the design collects trace data as the circuit runs, and a software tool that allows the user to replay the execution using the captured data. When searching for the root cause of a bug, the designer may need to modify the instrumentation to collect data from a new part of the design, requiring a lengthy recompile. In this paper, we propose a flexible debug overlay family that provides software-like debug turn-around times for HLS generated circuits. At compile time, the overlay is added to the design and compiled. At debug time, the overlay can be configured many times to implement specific debug scenarios without a recompilation. This paper first outlines a number of “capabilities” that such an overlay should have, and then describes architectural support for each of these capabilities. The cheapest overlay variant allows selective variable tracing with only a 1.7% increase in area overhead from the baseline debug instrumentation, while the deluxe variant offers 2x-7x improvement in trace buffer memory utilization with conditional buffer freeze support. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Debugging; Field-Programmable Gate Array; High-Level Synthesis","Computer debugging; Flexible electronics; High level synthesis; Integrated circuit design; Logic gates; Memory architecture; Program debugging; Signal receivers; Architectural support; Architecture exploration; Area overhead; Buffer memory; In-system debug; Recompilation; Source codes; Turn-arounds; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052762400

To date, no two sutures are the same with respect to the type of knot, tension, or suture material. With advancement in medical technologies, robotic suturing is becoming more and more important to operate on complex and difficult to reach internal surgical sites. While it is very difficult to translate a surgeon's suturing expertise to an automated environment, computational models could be employed to estimate baseline suture force requirements for a given wound shape, size, and suture material, which could be subsequently processed by a robot. In the literature, there have been few attempts to characterize wound closure and suture mechanics using simple two- and three-dimensional computational models. Single and multiple skin layers (epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis) and tissues with different wound geometries and sizes have been simulated under simple wound flap displacements to estimate suture force requirements. Also, recently, sutures were modeled to simulate a realistic wound closure via suture pulling, and skin prestress effect due to the natural tension of skin was incorporated in a few models to understand its effects on wound closure mechanics. An extensive review of this literature on computational modeling of wound suture would provide valuable insights into the areas in which further research work is required. Discussion of various computational challenges in modeling sutures in a numerical environment will help in better understanding the roadblocks and the required advancements in suture modeling. © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Finite element model (FEM); robotic surgery; suture; wound closure","Biomedical engineering; Computation theory; Computational methods; Finite element method; Numerical models; Robotics; Skin; Surgery; Computational model; Load modeling; Solid model; Suture; Two-dimensional displays; Wound closure; Wounds; Robotic surgery; biomechanics; computer simulation; finite element analysis; human; practice guideline; Review; robot assisted surgery; stress strain relationship; suture technique; wound; biological model; computer simulation; education; finite element analysis; robotic surgical procedure; suture technique; Computer Simulation; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Models, Biological; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Suture Techniques",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041500918

Since energy absorption is dependent upon the unique stress-strain response of each foam specimen, it is difficult to quantify analytically; thus, energy absorption cannot be easily compared across materials. Current methods accomplish this using an experimental approach, individually testing foam materials, densities, and geometries to quantify how each influences energy absorption. Such methods require large amounts of time and money to characterize a narrow range of foams. This paper facilitates foam selection by deriving generalized energy absorption material indices. Assuming Euler buckling of columns in the open-cell foam structure, this paper applies equations derived by Maiti et al. to a typical impact scenario wherein the indices are extracted. Using existing Ashby charts, these indices allow polymers to be ranked by the mass and cost each would require as a foamed structure to satisfy specific energy absorption constraints. The presented method allows the energy absorption of a wide range of flexible foams to be compared and relieves the need for extensive factor-specific testing.

This research applied and measured the impact of using surrogates to quickly model the stresses on a compressor blade. By modeling distinct points on a finite element (FE) model with unique surrogates, the stress field of the entire FE model was quickly predicted. This required that the distinct points remain in the same relative location on each blade used in training the surrogate. This research studied the ability of mesh morphing, and using the surface nodes as those distinct points, to satisfy this requirement. The results show that mesh morphing performed well on the tested compressor blades. The research also found that the surrogate accuracy depended not only on the number of training samples, but also the number and types of parameters being emulated. The surrogate models achieved less than 5% error on all the tested blades. Finally, the method provided a 96% decrease in time required for a structural iteration of a compressor blade. Such speeds eliminate bottlenecks that may occur in the structural design process. The combination of mesh morphing and surrogate modeling in compressor blade analysis enables exploration of various geometric parameters and their effect on structural responses.

However, the ability to rapidly assess the performance of these design concepts, with sufficient fidelity, is a current weakness of this nascent industry. This paper explores the capacity of the viscous Vortex Particle Method (VPM) to model wake interactions found in distributed propulsion. The elements of the vortex particle method are summarized, and a new approach for the calculation of vortex stretching through the complex-step derivative approximation is presented. Preliminary validation is performed on vortex ring cases resembling the fundamental dynamics encountered in propeller wakes. Unsteady wake dynamics of individual propellers are successfully modeled, replicating the instabilities that lead to vortex breakdown as observed experimentally. Comparing the method with results from momentum theory, it is shown that VPM is consistent with theoretical values of near and far field induced velocities, and a notable feature is its ability to model near/far field transition. Furthermore, VPM is able to fully characterize induced velocities across the entire wake, from the stable region where momentum theory operates, through instability transition and eventual vortex breakdown. The simulation of a multirotor configuration of two tip-to-tip propellers is shown, displaying the capacity of VPM to model wake mixing. The results presented here are intermediate steps in the development of a mid-fidelity modeling tool for the early design stages of distributed-propulsion electric aircraft. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Determining the end of primary consolidation is greatly exacerbated for layered soils that compress at varying rates. This paper discusses the use of magnet extensometer instrumentation to isolate compression within specific subsurface layers and associated techniques for estimating the time of construction induced settlement. Field data is used during construction to estimate the end of construction induced subsurface compression, which greatly affects the project schedule. This case study briefly summarizes instrumentation installation, data gathering, and the challenges associated with projecting the time of construction settlement. Two different curve fitting techniques were evaluated in this research: using standard primary consolidation equations and finite difference equations for estimating the end of primary consolidation settlement. For the site investigated, the curve fitting techniques proved to be somewhat problematic because the soil layers had small magnitudes of settlement and the transition between primary and secondary settlement was not readily apparent during the evaluation of real time field data. Using the finite difference equations also proved somewhat problematic trying to fit the full record of field data based on all of the different stages of loading. Additional lessons learned include the need for effective project communication between contractors, designers, and owners and a corresponding open discussion regarding practical settlement risk. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

No SR-HALE aircraft has yet accomplished this task due to the complex network of environmental, solar, structural, and aerodynamic trade-offs, among which aircraft exibility plays a key role. A comprehensive SR-HALE aircraft multidisciplinary design optimization framework is developed in which the exible aircraft analysis tool ASWING is incorporated in order to constrain nonlinear aeroelasticity. Energy, battery, ply thickness, material failure, local buckling, aerodynamic stall, longitudinal stability, and general stability (including utter) constraints are applied in order to reasonably constrain the optimized SR-HALE aircraft design. An SR-HALE aircraft design with a span length of 60:15m and a total aircraft weight of 432:2 kg is found which fulfills all SR-HALE mission requirements and minimizes aircraft mass. A further 21% reduction in total aircraft mass is found through the use of high modulus carbon fiber reinforced polymer. Significant decreases in aircraft mass, down to a total aircraft mass of 250.6 kg, are found to be possible if altitude requirements for SR-HALE aircraft are lowered from 18;288m to 16;764 m.

While fuel based propulsion technologies typically increase in specific power with increasing size, electric propulsion is typically much more scalable. This system scalability enables alternative designs including distributed propulsion, optionally powered propulsion units, and vectored thrust, which can all contribute to better runway performance and range. In this paper, we explore how continuously powered distributed propulsion can reduce takeoff distance while still satisfying range constraints. We use a combination of a blade element momentum method, a vortex lattice method, experimental data, and nonlinear optimization techniques to model and explore the design space. We have found that for this conceptual design study, a fully blown wing with propellers at the optimal diameter for the load (8 propellers for a 300 km range constraint) can reduce the takeoff distance by over 80% when compared to the optimal 2 propeller case using the same models. There is over a 2x increase in the wing lift coefficient which leads to a 36% reduction in liftoff speed. Also, the optimal fully blown case produced 2.9 more thrust during takeoff with only an 11% increase in total aircraft mass. Using propeller tip speed as a surrogate for noise, we found that the propeller tip speed decreased takeoff performance in an exponential manner: the tip speed could be decreased from Mach 0.8 to Mach 0.5 with only a 2x increase in takeoff rolling distance while decreasing the constraint to Mach 0.3 produced an 8x increase. © 2018, (publisher Name).

Because Kestrel’s mixing plane capabilities have been demonstrated in only limited cases, this research seeks to further validate the model using the Air Force Research Lab’s (AFRL) Rotor 4 fan. Extensive experimental data has been gathered for Rotor 4, allowing for in-depth comparisons to be made. Following the validation study, differences between the experimental results and the predictions from the mixing plane model are highlighted and discussed. These comparisons lead the authors to conclude that Kestrel’s mixing planes can be utilized to predict performance at various operating conditions and rotor speeds.

Superdirective antennas are commonly considered as transmitters, but thinking of the antenna as a receiver may help to understand and overcome some of these limits on practical superdirectivity. We directly model a superdirective antenna in receive mode by calculating streamlines of Poynting vector field near the receiving antennas. Superdirectivity is achieved by expanding the shape of the effective area beyond the antenna physical aperture area. The degree of superdirectivity is parameterized by an effective area expansion distance. The theory predicts that superdirectivity is practical for electrically small and middle size antennas and electrically large antennas with a large aspect ratio. With this motivation, a 1.5 λ × 2 λ superdirective horn antenna with resonant screen structure in front of the antenna aperture is designed and fabricated. The superdirective horn achieves a measured antenna efficiency of 115% over a reasonable bandwidth and with moderate sensitivity to fabrication errors. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Effective area shape; horn antennas; Poynting streamlines; superdirectivity","Antennas; Aspect ratio; Bandwidth; Dipole antennas; Electromagnetic waves; Receiving antennas; Aperture antennas; Effective area; Poynting streamlines; Shape; Superdirectivity; Horn antennas",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034230400

We first assess OpenSSL and its uses in open source software, recommending how this functionality should be accommodated within the POSIX API. We then propose the Secure Socket API (SSA), a minimalist TLS API built using existing network functions and find that it can be employed by existing network applications by modifications requiring as little as one line of code.

Our goal was to enable students to process designs they encounter, both in person and social media, through a critical and cultural perspective, and then turn those lenses towards their own design work with greater social and cultural awareness. To do this, we utilized Instagram as the primary platform (@byudesignhistory) for course discussion and altered the way we framed student assignments. This new curriculum was prototyped in the spring of 2018. Outcomes were measured by monitoring student engagement, responses, and comprehension scores on verbal and written assignments and examinations. Students also responded to a series of reviews to gather their perspectives on the class. Results indicate an increase in their understanding of the cultural position design holds in a way that was absent in student results from the previous course structure. If our course interventions are effective, students should move from concrete to abstract knowledge as well as from lower order to higher order thinking skills. Students will thus be better prepared to assess, understand and discuss both current and historical design cultures and trends while influencing their own design work through an informed perspective. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

However, if their observations and knowledge are not soon applied, the students hold only fond memories of a fun trip abroad. We believe that student’s retention and application of concepts will increase if educators give students greater autonomy on the trip and also expect and enable opportunities to apply their accrued knowledge on their own projects upon returning home. Nine third and fourth-year industrial design students Brigham Young University participated in a weeklong field study abroad to Dutch Design Week (DDW) in Eindhoven, Netherlands. A week after the completion of the study abroad the students filled out a survey about their motivations, feelings, criticisms, and aspects of the trip that influenced them as designers. Three and a half months later the students took a second survey asking about how they have applied insights gained from participation in DDW to their current projects. The results from the both surveys suggest the impact of the field study trip decreased over time. The observations and more open-ended questions in the survey helped determine if and how the students applied their conceptual knowledge to their current projects as well as other outcomes of the trip. In addition, the paper suggests possible strategies and research opportunities for future field study experiences. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

As project complexity increases, students are faced with information overload and can struggle to move forward in a meaningful way. Complex Problem Solving studies and Cognitive Load Theory suggest information reduction as a way to grasp the critical aspects of a problem and move beyond the impasse inherent with too much information. Segmentation and chunking are common strategies for information reduction but the abstraction inherent in the chunking process provides better conceptual understanding. The simplified but meaningful results from the chunking process can then be leveraged to create a model or framework that helps students organise and clarify what they have observed as well as point to new opportunities for design activity. Despite the fear of oversimplification, significantly abstracted models have great “explanatory or predictive power” and can lead to rich results. Reviewing the concepts of complexity, cognitive load, and contrasting segmentation with data chunking, this paper will then highlight a portion of a student project where information reduction provided understanding beyond initial student impressions and encouraged them to move forward. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

To test their knowledge, they applied their aesthetic insights to a simple industrial design problem.

As they increase in prevalence, how UAVs interact with each other and their environments will become increasingly important. The UAV air traffic control system will play an important role in keeping UAV-human interactions safe, effective, and efficient. The large number of automated agents, and the complex interactions between them, make this air traffic control system unusually complex. In this paper, the authors consider how the vertical distribution of UAVs affects an air traffic control system’s safety and efficiency. Several possible frameworks are examined, including a free-flight system in which UAVs are allowed to distribute themselves within the entire airspace; a stratified system where different layers are used for travel in different directions, and a compromise system where layers are specified, but vertical course deviation for conflict avoidance is permitted. Investigations are made into how prioritizing some UAVs over others in a hierarchy (for instance, giving emergency services UAVs a separate layer, independent of recreational or commercial users) could affect this system. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In 2014, an algorithm named the horizontal alignment finder (HAF) algorithm was developed to identify horizontal curves on rural two-lane two-way highways. Its accuracy was about 85 percent with 2012 data. The HAF was recently recalibrated for all other types of UDOT's highways and found to be applicable to them without any modifications in its main algorithm. During the calibration, six types of errors were identified. Four of the six errors were fixed and the HAF was calibrated with new 2015 LiDAR data.

With the development of reliable welding tools and precise control systems, FSW of steels has reached a new level of technical maturity. High-quality, long welds can be produced in many engineering steels. Compared to traditional fusion welding, FSW exhibits unique advantages producing joints with better properties. As a result of active control of the welding temperature and/or cooling rate, FSW has the capability of fabricating steel joints with excellent toughness and strength. For example, unfavorable phase transformations that usually occur during traditional welding can be avoided and favorable phase fractions in advanced steels can be maintained in the weld zone thus avoiding the typical property degradations associated with fusion welding.

Healing feasibility was demonstrated by processing a tapered crack using a PCBN/W-Re tool with a 25 mm diameter shoulder and a pin length of 6.4 mm. The experiment showed that it was possible to heal a crack that begins narrow and then progressively grows up to a width of 2 mm. Bead on plate experiments were used to find the best parameters for creating a consolidated stir zone with the least amount of hardness difference compared to the base metal. Grain refinement in some specimens resulted in much higher stir zone hardness, compared to base metal. A plot of grain size versus microhardness showed a very strong inverse correlation between grain size and hardness, as expected from the Hall-Petch relationship. Corrosion testing was carried out in order to evaluate the effect of FSP on potential sensitization of the stir zone.

To investigate feasibility, the simplest known energy harvester configuration is chosen. A mathematical model to represent the device is then developed.

Structures comprised of origami tessellations offer a means to achieve angular cavities that approach black-like behavior during collapse by exploiting use of the cavity effect. Expanded origami surfaces exhibit intrinsic radiative properties while collapsed surfaces exhibit increasingly black-like behavior as the cavity aspect ratio increases. Actuation of such surfaces provides the means to achieve any apparent radiative behavior between these two extremes. This work explores the use of three origami structures (finite V-groove, hinged V-groove and Miura-ori) and their respective apparent radiative properties as a function of cavity geometry using Monte Carlo ray tracing. Results are presented as a function of tessellation geometry and degree of actuation (i.e. collapse). Ray tracing models are benchmarked with V-groove geometries for which analytical models exist in the literature. Convergence for ray independence was determined to be satisfactory when the standard error of the mean for every test case was less than 0.005. Deviation in the apparent absorptivity for finite V-groove relative to the infinite V-groove is quantified. The apparent absorptivity of the Miura-ori fold exhibits sensitivity to the fold geometry when the angle of the unit cell is varied, but is relatively insensitive to the length ratio of the panel. The variable nature of the net radiative heat transfer, achievable through actuation, affords a method for thermal management of components with variable heat dissipation and/or variable radiative environments. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

This paper proposes a process for designing origami-based conceal-and-reveal systems, which can be generalized to design other thick, rigid origami-based systems. The process is demonstrated through the development of three conceal-and-reveal systems that present a luxury product to the consumer. The three designs also confirm that multiple origami crease patterns represent viable approaches to achieving conceal-and-reveal motion.

The time and knowledge required to manually model an origami mechanism can impede the exploration of the design space and creation of robust designs. This work presents data structures based on origami that can be used in the automation of thick-origami mechanism design. These structures are described and an example computer program that implements them is investigated. The program automatically generates all the necessary 3D CAD part models and an assembly model for a user-specified origami crease pattern. Models resulting from the program for several crease patterns are demonstrated with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the system. With further development of the data structures and program, this framework has the potential to help mitigate some of the barriers to more widespread use of origami-based design.

CVI results from incompetent venous valves. The purpose of venous valves is to prevent retrograde blood flow to the lower limbs. Valve failure can lead to edema, pain, and ulcers. One solution that has great potential is to create an implantable venous valve that could restore function of the venous system. No prosthetic venous valves are clinically used currently because of problems with biocompatiblility and thrombogenicity caused by high shear rates. This paper presents a prosthetic venous valve that could overcome these difficulties by using carbon-infiltrated carbon nanotubes (CI-CNTs). This material has been proven to be thrombo-resistant, biocompatible due to its non-reactive properties, and durable. The valve was designed to be initially open and to close with physiological pressures. Finite element modeling showed that, with a hydrostatic pressure of 20 mmHg (the minimum hydrostatic pressure in the common femoral vein), it fully closed with a maximum stress of 117 MPa, which is below the ultimate strength of CI-CNTs. A computational fluid dynamics analysis demonstrated the valve would cause a maximum shear rate of 225.1 s− 1, which is less than the maximum shear rate in the body. Hence, this valve would be less likely than previous prosthetic valves to develop blood clots. Currently, this is the lowest shear rate reported for a prosthetic venous valve. These results demonstrate that a CI-CNT prosthetic venous valve has the potential to be an effective treatment for CVI.

The resulting images rely on visual persistence as laser light scatters from the particle, which is rapidly swept through the 3-D pattern. Control can be maintained while moving the particle with air speeds up to 2 m/s. A desire to greatly increase the sweep speed motivates a re-examination of the fundamentals of photophoresis-based laser-particle traps. Most explanations offered are qualitative, with differing opinions as to whether, for example, asymmetric heating or asymmetric thermal accommodation is primarily at work. Which particles become trapped in the beam is typically based on self-selection, as a variety of particles with possible differing shapes and sizes are offered to the laser focus for capture. Characteristics that make some particles preferred over others are especially relevant. There is broad consensus that structure in the laser focus greatly aids in stable trapping. Nevertheless, it is still possible for even a relatively smooth TEM00 beam to capture and hold particles. Moreover, even in a structured focus (i.e. with aberrations and local intensity minima and maxima), questions remain as to exactly how a particle becomes stably trapped in certain beam locations. A zoomed-in look at trapped particles reveals oscillations or orbits with excursions over tens of microns and accelerations up to 10 gs. We trapped particles in zero-gravity as well as 2-g environments with no noticeable difference in stability. © 2018 SPIE.","Optical trapping; Photophoresis; Volumetric display","Laser beams; Micromanipulators; Asymmetric heating; Centimeter-scale; Laser particles; Microscopic particle; Opticaltrapping; Photophoresis; Thermal accommodation; Trapped particle; Three dimensional displays",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055502611

For example, intent can mean to find a path that balances between ""Go quickly"" and ""Go stealthily"". Given human expectations about how a path balances such tradeoffs, the path should match the human's intent throughout the entire execution of the path even if the environment changes. If the path drifts from the human's intent because the environment changes, then a new robotic-path needs to be planned - referred to as path-replanning. We discuss here three system-initiated triggers (prompts) for path-replanning. The objective is to create an interactive replanning system that yields paths that consistently match human intent. The triggers are to replan (a) at regular time intervals, (b) when the current robotic path deviates from the user intent, and (c) when a better path can be obtained from a different homotopy class. Further, we consider one user-generated replanning trigger that allows the user to stop the robot anytime to put the robot onto a new route. These four trigger variants seek to answer two fundamental critical questions: When is a re-planned path acceptable to a human? and How should a planner involve a human in replanning? © 2018 SPIE.","BDI; Commitment; Graphical user interfaces; Human-robot collaboration; Human-robot interaction; Human-robot teams; Intent; Intention; Multi-objective path planing; Plans; Reasoning; Replanning; Tradeoffs","C (programming language); Economic and social effects; Graphical user interfaces; Human computer interaction; Motion planning; Robotics; Commitment; Human-robot collaboration; Human-robot-team; Intent; Intention; Path planing; Plans; Re-planning; Reasoning; Tradeoffs; Human robot interaction",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050802041

The DPT consists of a 74 mm diameter cone tip driven by a 120 kg hammer with a free fall height of 1 m. To expand the data base, DPT soundings were performed at the Pence Ranch and Larter Ranch sites where gravelly soil liquefied during the 1983 Mw6.9 Borah Peak earthquake. DPT testing was performed using an automatic hammer with the energy specified in the Chinese standard and with an SPT hammer. In general, comparisons suggest that standard energy corrections developed for the SPT can be used for the DPT. The DPT correctly predicted liquefaction and non-liquefaction at these two test sites. Liquefaction resistance from the DPT (30% probability) also correlated reasonably well with that from Becker penetration testing (BPT).

Detailed information about the magnitude of distortion and the shape of the distortion profile and how it changes through blade rows increases the understanding of flow physics and helps predict aerodynamic performance. Using full annulus URANS simulations, this paper analyzes what happens to distortion as it passes through the rotor and stator blade rows at 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% span. Fourier distortion descriptors are used in this study to quantitatively describe distortion transfer and generation. With these descriptors, evidence of pressure-induced swirl is shown at the fan inlet. It is also shown that although there is very little distortion at the 10% span of the inlet, after passing through the rotor blade row the 10% span has the greatest amount of total pressure and total temperature distortion. This radial migration of distortion is attributed to the high hade angle of the hub. The total pressure and total temperature profiles have significant circumferential phase shifts after passing through the rotor and slight phase shifts after passing through the stator. In general, the calculated phase shifts are greatest at the 10% and 90% spans, the nearest locations to the hub and the tip clearance gap, respectively.

It can be difficult to predict the transfer of distortion through a compressor because traditional experimental and computational methods are very expensive and time consuming. The Harmonic Balance approach is a promising alternative which uses Fourier techniques to represent fluid flow solutions. Relatively little work has been done to assess how much Fourier information is necessary to calculate a sufficiently accurate solution with the Harmonic Balance Solver. This study focuses on analyzing the effects of varying the amount of modal content that is used in Harmonic Balance simulations. Inlet distortion profiles with varying magnitudes are used in order to analyze trends and provide insight into the distortion flow physics for various inlet conditions. The geometry is a single stage axial compressor that consists of an inlet guide vane followed by the NASA Stage 37 rotor. It is shown that simulations with greater magnitudes of distortion require more modal content in order to achieve sufficiently accurate results. Harmonic Balance simulations are shown to have significantly lower computational costs than simulations with a conventional unsteady solver. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

While the individual masonry components can be considered isotropic at the material level, masonry assemblages are anisotropic at the structural level. These properties of masonry make it difficult to develop models that accurately describe the material behavior for all analysis and design scenarios. One analysis tool that is efficient and reliable is the use of stress fields. Stress fields are based on the lower-bound theorem of the theory of plasticity. Stress fields have been combined with the truss analogy to produce what is known as the strut-and-tie modelling procedure. This article presents ongoing research that has the objective to develop strut-and-tie modelling procedures for masonry. The presented methodology uses the existing strut-and-tie guidelines for reinforced concrete as starting point and applies that methodology to the modelling of several masonry shear walls with openings. The shear strength predictions from the proposed strut-and-tie modelling methodology are shown to perform well compared to the experimental strengths. This is associated with the ability of the strut-and-tie modelling procedure to account for the geometric particularities of each wall. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).","Limit analysis; Masonry shear-wall; Masonry structures; Numerical modelling; Strut-and-tie model","Numerical models; Reinforced concrete; Shear walls; Limit analysis; Lower bound theorem; Masonry shear walls; Masonry structures; Modelling methodology; Shear strength predictions; Strut-and-tie model; Theory of plasticity; Stresses",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062312486

This reduces the cost of specialty laborers and the variability in construction that exists from the application of mortar. Several dry-stack systems exist and can be subcategorized as interlocking systems or surface bonded systems. In interlocking systems, the blocks are connected by their geometry while in surface bonded systems the blocks are connected by a structural coating applied to the surface of the wall. This article describes a finite element model that can be used to predict the in-plane capacity and behavior of dry-stack masonry walls with a surface coating. Four walls were built and tested for their in-plane shear capacity. Two walls were unreinforced and ungrouted and two walls were reinforced and grouted at 1.22 m both vertically and horizontally. The results of these tests were used to validate the finite element model. The finite element model was developed using VecTor2. The numerical response is in good agreement to measured response. For the ungrouted unreinforced walls, the calculated maximum load was within 4% and 14% of the measured maximum loads.

Freshman students may have difficulties regulating their emotions when exposed to new or complex topics such as engineering design. Consequently, they may become frustrated or discouraged as the semester progresses that can lead to feelings of hopelessness and anxiety. In contrast, novice students may experience feelings of hope and interest that may foster positive learning outcomes in engineering design. The authors explored freshmen engineering students’ (n = 58) levels of self-efficacy and topic emotions while participating on a freshmen-level engineering and graphics design course. Our findings suggests that while positive and negative topic emotions are inversely related, both seem to be associated with self-efficacy. Further, topic emotions appear to mediate self-efficacy as topic emotions such as curiosity, happiness, and interest were reported by engineering students during engineering design activities. Self-efficacy increased over the course of the semester for these freshman engineering design students. © 2019 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering design; Self-efficacy; Topic emotions","Curricula; Students; Engineering design; Engineering Design Activities; Engineering design course; Freshman engineering design; Freshmen engineering; Learning outcome; Self efficacy; Topic emotions; Engineering education",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060976164

The tensile pull-out strength of the composite rebar embedded in concrete was measured and compared to steel rebar. Fiberglass/epoxy is less likely to corrode than steel rebar, ensuring more sustainable concrete structures in infrastructure applications. The 0.5"" diameter composite rebar was produced by pulling hundreds of strands of unidirectional fiberglass/epoxy towpreg to form the core of a cylindrical rod. The rods were consolidated by overwrapping strands of aramid fiber under tension in a spiral fashion, and cured using the manufacturer's (TCR Composites) recommended 250°F cure cycle. Configurations manufactured and tested included tow variations of aramid overwrap (dry and prepreg) with and without sand coating embedded in concrete cubes (8""x8""x8""). The results are compared to baseline values obtained by testing traditional steel rebar and commercially-Available fiberglass composite rebar. The tensile pull-out (bond) strength was quantified using a test fixture in accordance with ACI 440.3R-12. Measurements were collected at both the free and loaded ends of the rebar, with freeend results yielding a more accurate indication of rebar bond stress. The bond strength of the in-house manufactured fiberglass/epoxy rebar was comparable to steel rebar and commercial fiberglass composite rebar. The sand coating increased the surface roughness, improving the bond strength of the composite rebar by margins of 43-58% percent. Fiberglass/epoxy composite rebar consolidated with prepreg aramid tow and subsequently coated with sand resulted in a bond strength slightly higher, but comparable to steel. This study demonstrates the ability to consistently produce high quality fiberglass/epoxy composite rebar using an innovative, low cost, high production rate, three-dimensional braiding process. © 2018 33rd Technical Conference of the American Society for Composites 2018.

Student engineering design teams with team members located at various locations should, during the early, middle, and late stages of the product development process, emphasize the use of collaboration tools that will best meet the needs of each stage. In the early stages, teams should emphasize rich communication mediums, such as in-person kick-off meetings. In the middle stages, tools which allow team members to perform their individual work while staying in-sync with their remotely located teammates, such as web conferencing and shared data editing tools, become important.

Recent improvements in measuring suction provided the ability to make fast, accurate SWCCs in the lab but sample throughput drastically limits the number that can be produced. Collocating matric suction and water content sensors in situ would add many more SWCCs to the knowledge base. The objective of this study is to determine how well in situ generated SWCCs using a new, calibrated matric sensor compare to those created in the lab. Field and lab SWCCs compared quite well, but a few factors reduced their agreement. In coarser textured soils, living roots caused a divergence as the soil suction increased. Not surprisingly, intact core samples compared more favorably than disturbed. In finer textured soils, comparisons were favorable, but were also affected when laboratory samples were disturbed. Data suggest collocated in situ sensors could provide an important augmentation to laboratory data for developing a wide range of SWCCs. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

The annular space between the pile and the sleeve is typically filled with uncompacted pea gravel. Designers often assume that the lateral resistance of the pile within the sleeve will be minimal; however, no test results are available to confirm this assumption. To investigate the lateral resistance of piles driven within CMS, a full-scale lateral load test was performed. The test pile configuration included a 32.4 cm (12.75 in.) pipe pile within a 60 cm (24 in.) CMS with uncompacted pea gravel filling the annular space. Results indicate that after small pile displacements, the lateral pile resistance was similar to that provided by an individual pipe pile and was even greater at larger displacements. As the pile displaced laterally, the gravel within the annular space became engaged and displaced the CMS into the compacted fill. Back-analyses indicate that the ultimate lateral pile resistance for this case can be approximated by treating the pipe-gravel-CMS as a composite pile having an EI equal to the pipe pile but with a diameter equal to the CMS. © ASCE.",,"Abutments (bridge); Corrugated metal; Gravel; Pile driving; Pile foundations; Annular space; Back analysis; Compacted fill; Composite piles; Lateral load tests; Lateral resistance; Pile displacement; Pipe piles; Piles",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048884022

To expand the data base, DPT soundings were performed at the Pence Ranch and Larter Ranch sites where gravelly soil liquefied during the 1983 Mw6.9 Borah Peak earthquake. DPT testing was performed using an automatic hammer with the energy specified in the Chinese standard and with an SPT hammer.

If different turbine hub heights and rotor diameters are included in the same wind farm, the wake interference in the farm will be reduced, resulting in a lower cost of energy (COE) than a farm with identical turbines. In this paper, we present a method to model wind farm COE in farms with hub heights and rotor diameters that vary across the wind farm. We also demonstrate how to optimize these wind farms to minimize COE. The results show that COE can be greatly reduced in wind farms with non-homogeneous turbines, especially when the turbines are spaced close together. For a unidirectional wind rose, including different turbine design in the wind farm has a similar decrease in COE to spreading the wind turbines farther apart. When the rotor diameter and hub height of the wind turbines in a farm are optimized uniformly, a COE decrease of 4% to 13% (depending on the grid spacing and wind shear exponent) is achieved compared to the baseline. When the rotor diameter and turbine heights are optimized non-uniformly, with two different diameters and heights throughout the farm, there is a COE decrease of 22% to 41% compared to the baseline. For a more spread wind rose with a dominant probability from the west, there is a COE decrease between 3% and 10% for uniformly optimized rotor diameter and height compared to the baseline. With two optimized rotor diameters and heights through the farm, a COE decrease of 3% to 19% is achieved. For a similar wind rose shifted such that the dominant wind direction is from the northwest, a COE decrease between 3% and 10% results from uniformly optimized wind turbines compared to the baseline. A COE decrease of 3% to 17% compared to the baseline occurs with two different turbines are optimized throughout the wind farm. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The goals of this research were to validate a method for organizing teams to maximize team performance and identify and validate metrics for individuals that would help in the organization of distributed teams of student engineers. A review of previous, related research is provided. A description of the proposed method of team organization is given, along with methods of data collection and a comparison of the proposed method to common methods. How students were divided into teams and each team's method of organizing sub-teams are described. Use of online surveys, tests, statistical methods, and other data gathering and analysis methods are explained. Statistical analysis of survey results and qualitative results of interviews and observations suggest that a profile-based method for organizing teams results in significantly higher team satisfaction. Some methods for measuring and/or predicting individual attributes related to teamwork, such as the significance of participation in team sports, were validated. No correlation was found between which university a student attended and a student's level of satisfaction with his or her team.

Instead, SOQPSK can be viewed as an ordinary, binary CPM.

Previously a detailed model was developed for soot formation depicting the soot particle size distribution using the method of moments with interpolative closure. This model is both accurate and complex. Computational expense of this model may be beyond many large-scale simulations. As a result, a simplified version of this detailed model has been developed. This simplified model makes two easy assumptions to drastically reduce the complexity of modeling soot formation. First assumption is that soot particles and soot precursors within a computational domain are assumed to be mono-dispersed, meaning all particles are the same size. This reduces the number of resolved terms to model both soot precursors and soot particles to three resolved terms rather than the 10+ terms required by the previously developed model. Second assumption is that all particles are spherical. While the simplified model is computationally less expensive, these two assumptions come with a cost in accuracy. Presented is both the development of this simplified model along with comparative simulations where the complex and simple models are ran. From these simulations, researchers and developers can justify which model may be used in their respective systems. © 2018 Western States Section/Combustion Institute.

Potential applications of the method include enabling 3D target classification algorithms and rapid geo-location. The method could also facilitate on-board reconstruction.

Six engine power conditions ranging from 25% to 150% engine thrust request were measured using a 71-microphone linear ground array located approximately 8 m from the estimated shear layer. Mixing noise trends with engine power for the round-nozzle F-35B are similar to those of a nominally rectangular-nozzle high-performance jet aircraft [Harker et al, AIAA, 2016]. Cross-correlation and coherence measures are used to corroborate and confirm identifications of fine- and large-scale turbulent mixing noise contributions from a concurrent study of the F-35B dataset [Neilsen et al., AIAA, 2018]. The relationships observed between multiple spatiospectral lobes seen in the maximum radiation regions of prior and concurrent high-performance aircraft noise studies [Leete et al., AIAA, 2018] are confirmed and expanded upon. Correlograms help identify how the multiple spatiospectral lobes have different apparent phase speeds across the array, corresponding to different directionality, some components of which also change with engine power. Increased overlap of lobes with increased engine power appears to drive global decreases in field coherence. Finally, the structure of the spatiospectral lobes appears to be more visible in nondimensionalized coherence length than in the spectrum itself. Broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) is found in the upstream direction at engine powers of 75% engine thrust request and above. Coherence is also used to separate BBSAN from jet mixing noise because the BBSAN is coherent within the relevant frequency range while adjacent fine-scale mixing noise is not. However, correlation and coherence analyses show that the upstream BBSAN signature is related to sound received in the peak radiation region dominated by the spatiospectral lobes. Possible links between the shock-associated noise and the spatiospectral lobes are discussed. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Synchronous measurements along a linear ground array approximately parallel to the shear layer were used to image the entire field through multisource statistically optimized near-field acoustical holography (M-SONAH). The field in the direction of maximum radiation consists of multiple lobes in the spatiospectral domain, which are manifest as multiple local maxima in space for a fixed frequency or multiple peaks in the spectra at a fixed location. Multiple lobes are observed at non-afterburning and afterburning engine conditions. As frequency increases for a given engine power, lobes appear towards the sideline and shift aft until they disappear beyond the measurement aperture and new lobe(s) take their place. As engine power is increased at a fixed frequency, the forwardmost lobe increases in its relative contribution to the field, which is a major contributing factor to the forward shift in overall directivity with increasing engine power. Field reconstructions and data in the forward direction outside of the region of maximum radiation show the presence of broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) for 75% ETR and above.

The primary noise sources originate from interactions between turbulent mixing noise associated with large and finescale turbulent structures and the ambient air. A nonideally expanded jet also contains broadband shock-associated noise. A three-way decomposition of the spectral density measured near a tied-down F-35B quantifies the contribution from each type of noise. The decomposition is performed on noise from a ground-based, linear array of microphones, approximately 8 m from the estimated shear layer, which spanned an angular aperture of 35° to 152° (relative to engine inlet). This large spatial aperture allows for a detailed investigation into the spatial variation in broadband shock-associated noise and fine and large-scale turbulent mixing noise. The spectral decompositions match the measured spectral levels with three main exceptions: 1) the F-35B noise contains multiple spectral peaks in the maximum radiation region, 2) nonlinear propagation increases the high-frequency spectral levels, and 3) the low-frequency levels in the maximum radiation region are less than those predicted by the large-scale similarity spectrum. The main peak of the F-35B broadband shock-associated noise, evident from 35°-70°, has the same characteristic shape and variation in peak frequency as overexpanded, laboratory-scale jets. The F-35B broadband shockassociated noise peak level and width exhibit different trends than laboratory-scale BBSAN and those recently reported for the F/A-18E [Tam et al., Journal of Sound and Vibration, Vol. 422, 2018, pp. 92-111]. The strengths and limitations of current models to represent the spatial variation in the spectral content of F-35B noise can guide research efforts to more fully understand the sound radiation from high-performance military aircraft. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Comparisons between flyover and ground run-up measurements for high-performance military aircraft have not been previously published. This paper presents comparisons between static ground run-up and flyover measurements for the F-35 operating at 150% Engine Thrust Request. The overall sound pressure levels and spectra are shown for the two scenarios, as well as indicators of nonlinear propagation and shock content, specifically the derivative skewness and average steepening factor. The overall sound pressure level is reduced in the peak radiation direction aft of the aircraft but increased in the forward direction. The peak frequency of the noise is relatively unaffected by flight effects, though the amplitude of each frequency may vary. The increase in level in the forward direction results in shock formation that is absent during ground run-up measurements. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

New fiber optic sensors with ruggedized construction and non-electrical components are subjected to accelerated aging tests and deployed in several installations with long service life. An overview of current progress with fiber optic technology is provided for fatigue monitoring, temperature, pressure, and strain sensing. Recent developments include improved service life, novel bonding methods, pipeline sensor station improvements, sensor calibration, and long-term fatigue analysis. The latest advancements are validated on multiple installations on a subsea tieback in the deepwater Mississippi Canyon of the Gulf of Mexico at 6, 500 ft depth. A prior third-party sensor design experienced multiple non-recoverable sensor failures. A new sensor station design is employed on two Flowline Terminations to monitor pressure and temperature at a rate of 100 Hz. Subsea tiebacks are susceptible to flow assurance issues caused by plugging events such as hydrate formation. The system was originally designed to track pig location but transitioned to pressure and temperature sensing. An issue with the transition was the lack of calibration relating the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain levels to the actual process conditions. A novel method is presented for in situ adjustment of the sensor array calibration. During the calibration procedure, the sensors produced unanticipated results during pipeline flow shut-in and later startup operations. The sensors helped uncover a configuration of the flowline and sensor locations that is valuable for detecting hydrate forming conditions at a key junction location. The sensors are located before and after the junction of two flowlines in the mixing zone of the pipeline streams. The novel contributions of this study are the high speed data collection, in situ fiber optic calibration, review of advancements in fiber optic sensing technology, and a field case study with multiple sensing arrays. The developments are part of the Clear Gulf study, a collaboration between the offshore energy industry and NASA that was formed in 2010. The objective of the Clear Gulf study is to employ space technology and testing facilities for use in the upstream industry to advance subsea sensor technology. The highly sensitive monitoring systems developed as part of this study are used to give early warnings for flow assurance issues, structural failures, or catastrophic events.

Such decisions are difficult to make primarily due to incomp lete information. We propose information design as a tool to help the entrepreneur to improve revenue by influencing backers' bel iefs. We introduce a heuristic algorithm to dynamically compute information-disclosure policies for the entrepreneur, followed by an empirical evaluation to demonstrate its competitiveness over the widely-adopted immediate-disclosure policy. Our results demons trate that the immediate-disclosure policy is not optimal when backers follow thresholding policies despite its ease of implementat ion.

Deployment kinematics follow the simplicity of a single degree of freedom mechanism for two of the three patterns. The panels are rigid, and articulations occur along the prescribed lines. These deployment architectures are compatible with storable tubular extendible member booms, articulated trusses, or continuous longeron coilable trusses, all commonly used to deploy spacecraft structures. High areal packaging densities were demonstrated: 1.0 m2/L for a diamond pattern with a high deployed aspect ratio and 0.5 m2/L for spiral and serpentine patterns compatible with high and low deployed aspect ratios. A double-layer material hinge method is also presented and used to enable the structures to fold, deploy, and be tensioned to a planar state. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

According to previous studies, there are two possible factors: the Mach waves, which are radiated from the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, and the acoustic waves generated in the impingement region. To distinguish the effects of these factors, this study compares the following three results: the overall sound pressure level distribution, images extracted from the schlieren visualization movies using acoustic-triggered conditional sampling, and tracing lines of the acoustic intensity vectors of the Mach waves. The results reveal that the nozzle–plate distance affects the fraction of the Mach waves that are generated in the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, resulting in a higher overall sound pressure level in the upstream direction for larger nozzle–plate distances. It is concluded that the location of the plate relative to the source region of the Mach waves significantly affects the acoustic phenomena, owing to the variation in the nozzle–plate distances.

A major cause for this concern arises from the fact that implementation of security protections occur at a local scale, while the important operational security issues stem from a global perspective of the system, e.g., mission assurance. Being able to understand network-wide implications of local cyber protections has the potential to significantly impact the strategies we use to protect modern mission systems. In this work, we present a graph-theoretic perspective on this problem, which is based on a framework for modeling and assessing the integrated cyber-physical dynamics of complex systems. Under the framework, these dynamics (and their relationships) are modeled as a graph and then analyzed using processing techniques from graphtheory. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by conducting insider-attack threat analysis and show how the application of security protections at a local scale impact network-wide security properties from an insider perspective. As a test case, we study the problem of search and rescue (SAR) using unmanned aerial vehicle teams. Unmanned vehicle teams engaged in SAR are prototypical cyber-physical systems, in which local intrusions may cause global disruptions. Here, we describe how the insider modeling framework for cyber-physical dynamics applies to this problem and present results of a network-wide assessment of security properties of the system. We use this assessment to design a security protection for the system in which we use cryptographically secure computation techniques to limit the amount of information sharing required between system components without degrading the correct operation of the system. We show how the application of these techniques on a local scale impacts the security properties of the system on a global scale. © 2018 SPIE.","cybersecurity; graph-theory; insider threat; multiparty computation; simulation; state inference","Antennas; Complex networks; Computation theory; Cryptography; Cyber Physical System; Dynamics; Embedded systems; Graph theory; Cyber security; Insider Threat; Multiparty computation; simulation; state inference; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049352433

However, in non-cooperative situations these unique characteristics are often disturbed. In this study, we examine the effect of six different factors on face detection in an unconstrained imaging environment: Image brightness, image contrast, focus measure, eyewear, gender, and occlusion. The aim of this study is twofold: First, to quantify detection rates of conventional Haar cascade algorithms across these six factors; and second, to propose methods for automatically labeling datasets whose size prohibits manual labeling. First, we manually classify a uniquely challenging dataset comprising 9,688 images of passengers in vehicles acquired from a roadside camera system. Next, we quantify how each of the aforementioned factors affect face detection on this dataset. Of the six factors studied, occlusion had the most significant impact, resulting in a 54% decrease in detection rate between unoccluded and severely occluded faces in our unique dataset. Finally, we provide a methodology for data analytics of large datasets where manual labeling of the whole dataset is not possible. © 2018 SPIE.","face recognition; image processing; machine learning; object detection","Classification (of information); Image processing; Learning systems; Luminance; Object detection; Cascade algorithm; Detection rates; Facial recognition; Image brightness; Image contrasts; Manual labeling; Non cooperative situations; Roadside cameras; Face recognition",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049184118

Two mortars were tested, with volume proportions of cement, lime and sand of 1:0.5:4 and 1:1:6. Two specimen heights, 50 and 140 mm, with diameter of 45 mm, resulting in diameter/height ratios of 1.0 and 0.3, respectively were used. The experimental results indicated that the confinement and strength of the mortar influence its stress-strain behavior: the larger the confinement, the more the non-linear behavior.

A numerical model was developed that accounted for the observations from the experimental phase with a nonlinear elastic phased analysis, which updates the modulus of elasticity and the Poisson's ratio at each new phase. The tangent modulus of elasticity was calculated directly from the experimental results while the Poisson's ratio was approximated using the model proposed by Ottosen. The numerical model presented satisfactory results, even close to the failure, when cracking is significant. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).","Compressive strength; Confinement; Mortar; Numerical model; Stress-strain behavior","Compressive strength; Elastic moduli; Lime; Mortar; Numerical analysis; Plasma confinement; Poisson ratio; Applied loads; Experimental and numerical analysis; Mortar specimens; Nonlinear behavior; Nonlinear elastics; Stress-strain behaviors; Numerical models",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062312347

It was developed to establish suitable teaching practice to educate students on efficient design methods in a distributed product realisation projects in conjunction with an industrial partner. Students work in international teams formed from multiple partner universities. Communication is primarily through video-conferencing and other synchronous and asynchronous means of communication to perform design tasks including the vision, conceptual design, detail design and prototyping. Students ultimately meet during the final workshop at the end of the course to assemble and test prototypes and to disseminate their work to the company and wider public. The CODEVE methodology was tested in the Erasmus+ funded project called Networked Activities for Realisation of Innovative Products (NARIP) from 2015-2107. It has been implemented in academic institution in Europe. This paper discusses applicability of this methodology in the project which connects universities and industry across the Atlantic. Three universities are participating this year: Brigham Young University from Utah, USA with Industrial Design students, University of Technology and Economics of Budapest in Hungary with product design students and City, University of London from the UK with mechanical, aeronautical and electrical engineering students. The industrial partner is Black Diamond, a global company based in Utah, USA, while the manufacturing of prototypes and final workshop are hosted at City, University of London. Time difference, culture and the discipline of study make implementation of CODEVE methodology in this transatlantic project more difficult than if the project is kept within European Universities. This paper outlines challenges and learning outcomes of students on both sides of Atlantic. Recommendations to modifications in CODEVE methodology to suit transatlantic projects are discussed in the paper. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

(Ref: OMAE2017-61494 Development and Testing of a Friction-Based Post-Installable Sensor for Subsea FiberOptic Monitoring Systems [1]). The prototype fiber-optic monitoring system collects a wide range of real-time data, which can be used to determine structural loading, fatigue, temperature, pressure, and flow assurance on operational platforms. The primary challenge of a post-installed instrumentation monitoring system is to ensure secure coupling between the sensors and the structure of interest for reliable measurements. Friction-based coupling devices have the potential to overcome installation challenges caused by marine growth and soil contamination on subsea structures, flowlines, or risers. This particular design solution is compatible with structures that are suspended in the water column and those that are resting on the seabed. In addition, the system can be installed by commercial divers in shallow depths or by remotely operated vehicles in deep-water applications. Operational limitations of the initial design concept were identified in the previous series of tests (2016-2017), and several innovative enhancements have been implemented which resulted in significant improvements in sensor system coupling and strain measurement correlation with traditional strain measuring devices. This paper provides a summary of the notable prototype design changes, full-scale test article buildup, and detailed performance data recorded during tension and compression loading that simulated representative offshore conditions. The test results were positive and demonstrated the effectiveness of the design enhancements. Compromises made during mounting of the sensing elements resulted in better performance in tension than compression. These effects are well understood and are fully discussed, and do not influence the viability of the design changes. This study is part of a continuing collaboration between the Houston-based NASA-Johnson Space Center and Astro Technology, Inc. within a study called Clear Gulf. The primary objective of the Clear Gulf study is to develop advanced instrumentation technologies that will improve operational safety and reduce the risk of hydrocarbon spillage. NASA provided unique insights, expansive test facilities, and technical expertise to advance these technologies that would benefit the environment, the public, and commercial industries.

Their thermal property information is limited, lacking experimental data on key properties such as thermal conductivity, specific heat, and CTE of the component fiber. This paper presents, for the first time, the thermal property data on kenaf fiber reinforced composites, and an approach to obtain the composite thermal properties based on constituent properties. Individual, plant-based fibers were measured independently and were then used to inform successful predictions of the effective thermal conductivity of the fiber reinforced composites. A unit cell model has been developed to predict the thermal properties of a planar, randomly oriented kenaf fiber-reinforced composite (near 22% volume fraction loading), which includes the effect of void content on the predicted thermal conductivity. A lower-level model is also developed for individual fiber thermal properties based on its constituents (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose). To validate this multi-level model, experimental measurements of the thermal diffusivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and specific heat for the composite, the matrix, and the fibers were performed in the range from 30 °C to 160 °C, based on TMA, DSC, LFA, and transient electro-thermal (TET) techniques. Model results compare favorably with the experimental data, and are consistent with FEM modelling results based on fiber properties and fiber constituent materials (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose). This approach provides the basis for understanding component contribution to the fiber properties, as well as a technique to obtain fiber composite thermal property based on component properties. The composite thermal property data also fills an information gap and can be directly used in component design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-composite; Kenaf; Multi-level modelling; Thermal conductivity; Transient-electrothermal technique","Cellulose; Dispensers; Environmental impact; Fiber reinforced materials; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Hemp; Hybrid materials; Kenaf fibers; Lignin; Natural fibers; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Specific heat; Thermal expansion; Thermodynamic properties; Composite thermal properties; Constituent materials; Eco-composites; Effective thermal conductivity; Experimental investigations; Fiber reinforced composites; Kenaf; Multilevels; Thermal conductivity; Cellulose; Composites; Kenaf; Lignins; Thermal Conductivity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030177818

One such technology is the novel CO2-Binding Organic Liquid (CO2BOL) process developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The process utilizes their anhydrous CO2BOL solvent in place of amine mixtures to reduce the energy penalty. A full-scale model of this system based on NETL's Case 10 power plant is projected to produce 7-16% more net electric power over a traditional MEA system for the same plant. These full-scale model predictions are promising, however full-scale simulations are difficult to validate using only bench-scale data. There are errors in both the measurements and models that need to be considered in addition to uncertainties introduced by up-scaling. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a statistical framework used to better understand these uncertainties as well as data gaps in models. By constraining models to data, distributions of model parameters are estimated and then propagated through the model to obtain distributions of key outputs such as carbon capture percent, energy penalty, stripper temperature, etc. The results from this UQ analysis aid the design of experiments (DoE) which identifies data gaps to fill to improve model accuracy. Using UQ and DoE effectively can reduce the development time of new carbon capture by years and save time and money on the path to a pilot, and ultimately full-scale, plant.

We propose a collision-detection algorithm based on the geometric relationship between encountering aircraft. If a collision threat is detected, a collision-free new path is generated for the ownship using a two-step path-planning algorithm. In the first step, an initial suboptimal path is generated using an A search.

Sustainability concerns apply to many critical resources such as water. On a per capita basis, the U.S. leads the world in water usage, with a substantial portion of water consumed/leaked by infrastructure systems. Because of water availability, competing water demands, and changing hydrologic conditions, the U.S. Department of Interior predicts that multiple water conflicts will occur in the western U.S. by 2025. In addition, decades of excessive demands on ecological systems have reduced their capacities to absorb and process emissions and wastes. Sustainable water infrastructure is vital to providing the American public with clean and safe water and helping to ensure the environmental, economic, and social health of the nation's communities. The increasing interest in sustainability has led to the development of sustainability assessment tools such as life cycle assessments (LCA) analyzing the embodied energy and environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool used to identify the environmental impacts of a product, process, or activity over the entire lifespan of the product. LCA studies also quantify and interpret the environmental flows to and from the environment (including emissions to air, water, and land, as well as the consumption of energy and other material resources) over the entire life cycle of a product (or process or service). By including the impacts throughout the product life cycle, LCA provides a comprehensive view of the environmental aspects of the product and an accurate picture of the true environmental tradeoffs in product selection. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Environmental impact; Global warming; Pipelines; Surveys; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water treatment; Department of interiors; Environmental sustainability; Global warming potential; Hydrologic conditions; Infrastructure systems; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Sustainability assessment; Underground infrastructure; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050919234

Because of the lack of large scale tests, there is almost no guidance for engineers in assessing the lateral resistance of piles located close to these MSE walls. The objective of this study was to assess lateral pile resistance as a function of distance from the wall face and predict force induced in the reinforcements. Full-scale lateral load tests were conducted on 24 piles located at 2, 3, 4, and 5 pile diameters behind 4.6 and 6-m high MSE walls. P-multipliers were developed to account for the decrease in lateral soil resistance. Little reduction occurred for piles located more than about 4 pile diameters from the wall. Measured tensile forces in the MSE reinforcements increased as the load on the pile increased and decreased rapidly with transverse distance from the direction of loading. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to predict maximum tensile force induced in reinforcing elements by lateral loading. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).All Rights Reserved.",,"Linear regression; Loads (forces); Pile driving; Reinforcement; Retaining walls; Large scale tests; Lateral load tests; Lateral resistance; Maximum tensile force; Mechanically stabilized earth wall; Multiple linear regression equations; Reinforcing elements; Thermal variation; Piles",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048930595

However, many utilities have not historically tracked all of the elements of water main break data. One factor used to quantify the occurrences of failing underground pipe networks is water main break rates. Water main break rates are calculated for all pipe materials used in water delivery to create a measurement to judge pipe performance and durability. Water main break rates can vary year to year and by utility. However, in aggregate, break rates produce a compelling story which can aid our prudent decision making as it relates to repairing and replacing our underground pipes. In April 2012, Utah State University published an initial comprehensive survey of water utilities. This was a survey of water main breaks and operating characteristics at utilities located in U.S. and Canada. Six years later in 2018, a new water main break study was released reviewing the national metric for citizens served per one mile of pipe, aggregate data on pipe material break rates, the analysis of age and corrosion in failure modes, and related observations on pressure, delivery volumes, effects of soil corrosivity, and trenchless technology practices. This paper reviews the newest water main break study metrics and findings and outlines various trends and projections of water main breaks in the U.S. and Canada which can be used to benchmark an organization's water main breaks and use this critical data in asset management plans. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Aggregates; Asset management; Decision making; Pipeline corrosion; Pipelines; Slip forming; Surveys; Underground corrosion; Water supply; Asset management plan; Operating characteristics; Replacement projects; Soil corrosivity; Trenchless technologies; Underground pipes; Utah state universities; Water industries; Trenching",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063460461

Inhaled corticosteroid is a popular medication for treating chronic respiratory diseases. Its side effects include decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis. The aims of this study are to investigate the association of inhaled corticosteroids and fracture and to design a clinical support system for fracture prediction. The data of patients aged 20 years and older, who had visited healthcare centers and been prescribed with inhaled corticosteroids within 2002-2010, were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). After excluding patients diagnosed with hip fracture or vertebrate fractures before using inhaled corticosteroid, a total of 11645 patients receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy were included for this study. Among them, 1134 (9.7%) were diagnosed with hip fracture or vertebrate fracture. The statistical results showed that demographic information, chronic respiratory diseases and comorbidities, and corticosteroid-related variables (cumulative dose, mean exposed daily dose, follow-up duration, and exposed duration) were significantly different between fracture and nonfracture patients. The clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) were designed with integrated genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVM) by training and validating the models with balanced training sets obtained by random and cluster-based undersampling methods and testing with the imbalanced NHIRD dataset. Two different objective functions were adopted for obtaining optimal models with best predictive performance. The predictive performance of the CDSSs exhibits a sensitivity of 69.84-77.00% and an AUC of 0.7495-0.7590. It was concluded that long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids may induce osteoporosis and exhibit higher incidence of hip or vertebrate fractures. The accumulated dose of ICS and OCS therapies should be continuously monitored, especially for patients with older age and women after menopause, to prevent from exceeding the maximum dosage. © 2018 Yung-Fu Chen et al.",,"Artificial intelligence; Bone; Decision support systems; Drug products; Genetic algorithms; Health insurance; Intelligent control; Patient monitoring; Patient treatment; Pulmonary diseases; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Bone mineral density; Clinical decision support systems; Clinical support systems; Demographic information; Fracture prediction; Imbalanced dataset; Objective functions; Predictive performance; Fracture; corticosteroid; corticosteroid; adult; aged; Article; chronic respiratory tract disease; clinical decision support system; comorbidity; controlled study; data base; demography; follow up; fracture; genetic algorithm; human; major clinical study; middle aged; prediction; sensitivity analysis; statistical analysis; support vector machine; young adult; algorithm; area under the curve; bone density; breathing disorder; complication; drug effect; epidemiology; factual database; female; health insurance; hip fracture; inhalational drug administration; male; osteoporosis; prevalence; prospective study; software; spine fracture; Taiwan; Administration, Inhalation; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Area Under Curve; Bone Density; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Female; Hip Fractures; Humans; Insurance, Health; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Respiration Disorders; Software; Spinal Fractures; Support Vector Machine; Taiwan; Young Adult",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056083602

GIS (geographic information system) helps to empower a utility with the tools to drive a robust and strategic, decision making process. When a CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) has asset management functionality, the capabilities of service requests, inspections and work orders, capturing costs, and work history can be leveraged into asset condition and risk-based spatial analysis by determining what, when, why, and where the next round of investment should occur. A critical step in the process includes analyzing the data and location to potential take actions to reduce the risks. In alignment with ISO (International Standards Organization) 55000, risk is defined as the probability of failure (PoF) multiplied by the consequence of failure (CoF) which produces the business risk exposure (BRE). While calculating risk is important, the risk-based data can be used to build business cases and determine future projects. GIS can help users gain an understanding of what assets are high risk, where they are located and what factor can influence the risk. Risk-based analysis provides the reasoning for potential solutions and action.

Images obtained by the Cassini spacecraft's synthetic aperture radar reveal morphologies, roughness, textural patterns and other properties consistent with fan analogues on Earth also viewed by synthetic aperture radar. The observed fan characteristics on Titan reveal some regions of high relative relief and others with gentle slopes over hundreds of kilometres, exposing topographic variations and influences on fan formation. There is evidence for a range of particle sizes across proximal to distal fan regions, from c. 2 cm or more to finegrained, which can provide details on sedimentary processes. Some features are best described as alluvial fans, which implies their proximity to high-relief source areas, while others are more likely to be fluvial fans, drawing from larger catchment areas and frequently characterized by more prolonged runoff events.

As the diffusion tensor model has limitations in brain regions with crossing fibers, novel diffusion MRI reconstruction models may offer more accurate measures of tissue properties, and a better understanding of the brain abnormalities in specific diseases. Here we studied a large sample of 249 participants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a neurogenetic condition associated with high rates of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, and 224 age-matched healthy controls (HC) (age range: 8-35 years). Participants were scanned with dMRI at eight centers worldwide. Using a meta-analytic approach, we assessed the profile of group differences in four diffusion anisotropy measures to better understand the patterns of WM microstructural abnormalities and evaluate their consistency across alternative measures. When assessed in atlas-defined regions of interest, we found statistically significant differences for all anisotropy measures, all showing a widespread but not always coinciding pattern of effects. The tensor distribution function fractional anisotropy (TDF-FA) showed largest effect sizes all in the same direction (greater anisotropy in 22q11DS than HC). Fractional anisotropy based on the tensor model (FA) showed the second largest effect sizes after TDF-FA; some regions showed higher mean values in 22q11DS, but others lower. Generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) showed the opposite pattern to TDF-FA with most regions showing lower anisotropy in 22q11DS versus HC. Anisotropic power maps (AP) showed the lowest effect sizes also with a mixed pattern of effects across regions. These results were also consistent across skeleton projection methods, with few differences when projecting anisotropy values from voxels sampled on the FA map or projecting values from voxels sampled from each anisotropy map. This study highlights that different mathematical definitions of anisotropy may lead to different profiles of group differences, even in large, well-powered population studies. Further studies of biophysical models derived from multi-shell dMRI and histological validations may help to understand the sources of these differences. 22q11DS is a promising model to study differences among novel anisotropy/dMRI measures, as group differences are relatively large and there exist animal models suitable for histological validation. © SPIE.

Flight test video was recorded and processed with a relatively simple visual odometry method. The aircraft attitude is then estimated with the visual odometry as the state propagation and network providing the attitude measurement in an extended Kalman filter.

These thermophysical properties are related to each other through temperature derivatives of thermodynamic relationships stemming from a temperature-dependent vapor-pressure correlation. The Riedel equation has been considered to be an excellent and simple choice among vapor-pressure correlating equations [ Velasco et al. J. Chem. Thermodyn. 2008, 40 (5), 789-797 ] but requires modification of the final coefficient to provide thermodynamic consistency with thermal data [ Hogge et al. Fluid Phase Equilib. 2016, 429, 149-165 ]. New predictive correlations with final coefficients in integer steps from 1 to 6 have been created for compounds with limited or no vapor-pressure data, based on the methodology used originally by Riedel [ Chem. Ing. Tech. 1954, 26 (2), 83-89 ]. Liquid heat capacity was predicted using these vapor-pressure correlations, and the best final coefficient values were chosen based on the ability to simultaneously represent vapor pressure and liquid heat capacity. This procedure improves the fit to liquid heat-capacity data by 5-10% (average absolute deviation), while maintaining the fit of vapor-pressure data similar to those of other prediction methods. Additionally, low-temperature vapor-pressure predictions were improved by relying on liquid heat-capacity data. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Binary mixtures; Forecasting; Hydrostatic pressure; Liquids; Temperature; Thermodynamic properties; Thermodynamics; Vapor pressure; Average absolute deviation; Correlating equations; Design and optimization; Predictive correlation; Temperature dependent; Temperature derivatives; Thermodynamic consistency; Thermodynamic relationships; Specific heat",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038401526

It is assumed that separate Kalman filters are employed by each sensor and no measurements of known landmarks are available. Accurate bias estimation is achieved through the use of pseudo measurements of slant range from each sensor to the target and pseudo measurements of each sensor's bias. The covariance intersection (CI) algorithm is used to produce a pseudo measurement of slant range. This pseudo measurement of range allows pseudo measurements of sensor bias to be calculated based on each sensor's residuals and Kalman gains. Substantially improved tracking performance is demonstrated when estimating and accounting for constant biases on each sensor. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Clutter (information theory); Intelligent robots; Bias estimation; Constant bias; Covariance intersection; Measurements of; Multi target tracking system; Pseudo measurements; Sensor model; Tracking performance; Target tracking",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041959272

Design techniques for aperiodic arrays include thinning, numerical optimization, and other methods, but even with modern tools, designing electrically large aperiodic arrays remain computationally challenging. To reduce the complexity of the large aperiodic array design problem, we study the use of discrete rotated tiles with element positions and tile orientations optimized to minimize peak sidelobe level (PSLL). The directivity, frequency sensitivity of PSLL, and optimization complexity for uniform arrays, aperiodic arrays, and tiled arrays are compared. Based on many numerical examples, an approximate relationship between PSLL and array element number and density for aperiodic and tiled arrays is proposed as a convergence estimator for the design optimization process. © 2017 IEEE.","Aperiodic arrays; array antennas; peak sidelobe level (PSLL); rotated tiles","Antenna lobes; Numerical methods; Optimization; Aperiodic arrays; Aperture efficiency; Array antennas; Design technique; Electrically large; Frequency sensitivity; Numerical optimizations; Peak sidelobe level; Antenna arrays",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032450039

Recent research has linked concussions with long term health complications such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy and early onset Alzheimer’s. Understanding the mechanical characteristics of concussive impacts is critical to help protect athletes from these debilitating diseases and is now possible using helmet-based sensor systems. To date, real time on-field measurement of head impacts has been almost exclusively measured by devices that rely on accelerometers or gyroscopes attached to the player’s helmet, or embedded in a mouth guard. These systems monitor motion of the head or helmet, but do not directly measure impact energy. This paper evaluates the accuracy of a novel, multifunctional foam-based sensor that replaces a portion of the helmet foam to measure impact. All modified helmets were tested using a National Operating Committee Standards for Athletic Equipment-style drop tower with a total of 24 drop tests (4 locations with 6 impact energies). The impacts were evaluated using a headform, instrumented with a tri-axial accelerometer, mounted to a Hybrid III neck assembly. The resultant accelerations were evaluated for both the peak acceleration and the severity indices. These data were then compared to the voltage response from multiple Nano Composite Foam sensors located throughout the helmet. The foam sensor system proved to be accurate in measuring both the HIC and Gadd severity index, as well as peak acceleration while also providing additional details that were previously difficult to obtain, such as impact energy. © 2017, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Acceleration; Football helmet; Impact detection; Impact energy; Impact velocity; Piezoelectric foam; Self-sensing foam; Severity index","Acceleration; Accelerometers; Fatigue crack propagation; Nanocomposites; Nanosensors; Safety devices; Sporting goods; Sports; Football helmet; Impact detection; Impact energy; Impact velocities; Self-sensing; Severity index; Foams; nanocomposite; nanocomposite; polyurethan; polyurethan foam; acceleration; Article; comparative study; foam; football; football player; Gadd severity index; injury scale; injury severity; kinematics; piezoelectricity; priority journal; velocity; accelerometry; chemistry; conductometry; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; evaluation study; helmet; human; nanotechnology; pressure transducer; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; sports equipment; Acceleration; Accelerometry; Conductometry; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Football; Head Protective Devices; Humans; Nanocomposites; Nanotechnology; Polyurethanes; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sports Equipment; Transducers, Pressure",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029003871

Participants were 20 adults (ten males and ten females) with no history of speech, language, or hearing disorders. They produced six target utterances in the three speaking conditions. Movements of the following articulators were recorded with an electromagnetic articulograph: Mid tongue, front of tongue, jaw, lower lip, and upper lip. The kinematic metrics were averages derived from movement strokes defined by minima in the speed record of each articulator. These measures revealed a number of significant changes between the voiced and mouthed conditions, with relatively few differences between voiced and whispered speech. Significant increases in sentence duration, articulatory stroke count, and stroke duration as well as significant decreases in peak stroke speed, stroke distance, and hull areas were found in the mouthed condition. These findings suggest that both laryngeal activation and auditory feedback play an important role in the production of normally articulated vocal tract movements, and that the absence of these may account for the significant changes in articulation between the voiced and mouthed conditions. © 2014 IEEE.","Articulatory kinematics; auditory feedback; silent articulation; voicing; whisper","Audition; Speech recognition; Auditory feedback; Hearing disorders; Stroke counts; Vocal tract movements; voicing; whisper; Whispered speech; Kinematics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040442393

Unfortunately, analysis of these models to extract the relevant physics is never as easy as applying machine learning to a large data set in the first place. Here we present a description of atomic systems that generates machine learning representations with a direct path to physical interpretation. As an example, we demonstrate its usefulness as a universal descriptor of grain boundary systems. Grain boundaries in crystalline materials are a quintessential example of a complex, high-dimensional system with broad impact on many physical properties including strength, ductility, corrosion resistance, crack resistance, and conductivity. In addition to modeling such properties, the method also provides insight into the physical ""building blocks"" that influence them. This opens the way to discover the underlying physics behind behaviors by understanding which building blocks map to particular properties. Once the structures are understood, they can then be optimized for desirable behaviors. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"Corrosion resistance; Crystallites; Grain boundaries; Nanocrystalline materials; Approximate function; Boundary systems; Building blockes; Crack resistance; High dimensional spaces; High-dimensional systems; Large datasets; Physical interpretation; Machine learning",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030982810

Link gain in hallways and connected laboratories looks similar at the two frequencies when the effect of lower effective receive antenna aperture with increasing frequency is removed. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation through a wall or around hallway corners exhibits approximately 5-20 dB (11 dB on average) greater loss beyond the 20 dB aperture loss at 24 GHz compared to that at 2.55 GHz. Fixed directional antennas increase path loss (PL) by an average of 13 dB when misaligned.

Research questions: 1. Do professionals prefer plain style? 2a. Do preferences differ for different categories of style? 2b. Do preferences differ for different groups of workers? Literature review: Style, the word- and sentence-level elements in a written text, is a critical element of plain language. There is evidence that plain style, however, affects readers differently based on their level of subject matter knowledge. Plain style is even criticized by a few. There is a long history of tensions surrounding linguistic prescriptivism, the notion that one manner of language use is superior to all others. Further, readers' preferences for writing style, plain or otherwise, may not be consistent across occupational positions, education levels, nationalities, personality types, or genders. Research methodology: We conducted a quantitative study of preferences for two major style categories (conciseness and word choice) using an online survey instrument. The student-recruiter technique provided us with usable responses from 614 working adults in the US. Using that data, we calculated proportions of respondents, with confidence intervals, who chose the plain-style options. We also used statistical tests to explore associations between preferences and respondent characteristics. Results and conclusions: Our findings support an overwhelming preference for plain style among US professionals who are native speakers of English. Reader preferences were stronger for elements associated with word choice than with conciseness. Those with lower education levels and blue-collar occupations had lower preferences for plain style. The study had two major limitations: 1. We investigated only two aspects of plain style rather than the full range of elements that make up plain language. 2. Our data-collection instrument presented readers with an artificial rather than an authentic reading experience. Future research may investigate the role of personality on stylistic preferences and the attributions readers make about writers based on their style. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Conciseness; language use; professional writing; word choice; writing style","Bibliographies; Education; Electronic mail; History; Industrial relations; Instruments; Professional aspects; Conciseness; language use; Pragmatics; Word choices; Writing style; Teaching",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034268570

The acoustic radiation mode approach for computing sound power was developed in the early 1990s and has since been widely used. It has been shown to be a rather efficient approach for determining the radiated sound power. In previous research, radiation mode expressions have been developed for planar and spherical structures, as well as axisymmetric modes of internal and external radiation from cylinders. In this work, the radiation modes for external radiating cylinders which account for both axial and circumferential dependence are presented. The expressions are uniquely developed using cylindrical basis functions which are a more natural match to the geometry than past developments, which have been based on spherical harmonics. Higher order radiation modes than have been previously presented are shown. The “leapfrog effect”, whereby higher order modes leapfrog over lower modes in terms of their radiation efficiencies as the frequency goes above the cut-on frequency for those modes, is discussed in detail. The relationships between the mode efficiency and the coincidence effect associated with the cut-on frequencies of the vibration modes are described. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic basis functions; Cut-on phenomena.; Cylindrical shell; Radiation mode shapes","Acoustic radiators; Cylinders (shapes); Efficiency; Functions; Shells (structures); Acoustic radiation modes; Basis functions; Circular cylindrical shells; Critical design parameters; Cut-on phenomena; Cylindrical shell; Radiation efficiency; Radiation mode; Radiation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027492964

Losses for single antennas can be minimized using high conductivity materials. It is less well understood that loss for array antennas is also influenced by mutual coupling between array elements and the beamformer weights applied to the signal from each element. In this paper, we study the antenna loss and receiving efficiency for phased array antennas and focal plane phased array feeds. To better elucidate the physics of array antenna loss related to mutual coupling and beamformer weights, losses for a coupled array can be lumped into an array effective resistance similar to the loss resistance of an equivalent single antenna. Numerical results show that although the antenna loss for a single isolated array element is low, the array antenna loss can be significantly increased by mutual coupling, particularly for beams with a large scan angle. © 2017 IEEE.","Array effective resistance; mutual coupling; phased array antennas; phased array feeds; receiving efficiency; scanned beams","Antenna arrays; Antenna feeders; Antenna radiation; Beamforming; Directional patterns (antenna); Efficiency; Electric resistance; Radio astronomy; Radio communication; Receiving antennas; Satellite communication systems; Effective resistances; Loaded antennas; Mutual coupling; Phased array antennas; Phased array feeds; scanned beams; Antenna phased arrays",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029169874

For infusion under a flexible membrane, such as vacuum infusion, or for simulation of a part with non-uniform thickness, one must test the permeability at various levels of compaction. This process is time consuming and often relies on interpolation or extrapolation around a few experimental permeability measurements. To accelerate the process of permeability characterization, a small number of methodologies have been previously presented in the literature, in which the permeability may be tested at multiple fiber volume contents in a single test. Some of the methods even measure the permeability over a continuous range of thicknesses, thus requiring no later interpolation of permeability values. A novel method is presented here for the rapid measurement of permeability over a continuous range of fiber volume content, in a single unidirectional vacuum infusion flow experiment. The thickness gradient across the vacuum bag, as well as the fluid pressure at several locations in the mold were concurrently measured to calculate the fabric compressibility. An analytical flow model, which accounts for the compressibility, is then used by iterating the fitting constant in a permeability model until the predicted flow front progression matches empirical measurement. The method is demonstrated here for two reinforcement materials: (1) a fiberglass unbalanced weave and (2) a carbon biax non-crimped fabric. The standard deviation across the multiple experiments for each material and flow orientation ranged from 12.8% to 29.7%. Validation of these results was performed by comparing the resulting permeability with multiple non-continuous permeability measurement methods. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","liquid composite molding; Permeability; vacuum infusion","Carbon; Compressibility; Interpolation; Mechanical permeability; Molding; Optimization; Reinforcement; Empirical measurement; Fiber volume content; Liquid composite molding; Non-uniform thickness; Permeability measurements; Reinforcement materials; Thickness gradients; Vacuum infusion; Characterization",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032700813

The smoothness of the T-spline basis functions accommodate large deformations of the capsule without the need for additional smoothing techniques, and can be used to accurately compute the membrane load. A balanced distribution of membrane elements can be constructed using an unstructured locally refined mesh. These properties are coupled with an adaptive temporal implicit integration scheme.

The method is applied to impact loading investigations of a stiffened composite skin panel. The reflected spectrum of each FBG in an array, embedded in the panel, is collected at 100 kHz during the impact events with a spectral resolution down to 40 pm. Visualization of the FBG responses to these impact events, including the presence of spectral distortion in some FBG spectra, is presented.

This approach adds security to existing applications, relieving developers of this burden. The benefits of this paradigm are three-fold-(1) increased correctness in the implementation of security features, (2) coverage for all software, even non-maintained legacy software, and (3) more rapid and consistent deployment of threat mitigations and new security features. To demonstrate these benefits, we describe three concrete instantiations of this paradigm- MessageGuard, a system that layers end-to-end encryption in the browser; TrustBase, a system that layers authentication in the operating system; and software-defined perimeter, which layers access control at network middleboxes. © 2017 IEEE.","Application security; Layered security; Repairing Applications; Secure software development; Security","Access control; Application programs; Cryptography; Security systems; Software design; Application security; End-to-end encryption; Layered security; Legacy software; Secure software development; Security; Security features; Threat mitigation; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035780227

However, aside from avoiding enzyme active sites or protein-binding interfaces, distinguishing the optimal PEGylation site from the available alternatives has conventionally been a matter of trial and error. As part of a continuing effort to develop guidelines for identifying optimal PEGylation sites within proteins, we show here that the impact of PEGylation at various sites within the β-sheet model protein WW depends strongly on the identity of the PEG-protein linker. The PEGylation of Gln or of azidohomoalanine has a similar impact on WW conformational stability as does Asn-PEGylation, whereas the PEGylation of propargyloxyphenylalanine is substantially stabilizing at locations where Asn-PEGylation was destabilizing. Importantly, we find that at least one of these three site-specific PEGylation strategies leads to substantial PEG-based stabilization at each of the positions investigated, highlighting the importance of considering conjugation strategy as an important variable in selecting optimal PEGylation sites. We further demonstrate that using a branched PEG oligomer intensifies the impact of PEGylation on WW conformational stability and also show that PEG-based increases to conformational stability are strongly associated with corresponding increases in proteolytic stability. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"macrogol; macrogol derivative; protein; amino acid sequence; Article; beta sheet; circular dichroism; conjugation; enzyme active site; protein binding; protein conformation; protein degradation; reduction (chemistry); beta sheet; chemistry; metabolism; molecular model; protein degradation; protein stability; Amino Acid Sequence; Models, Molecular; Polyethylene Glycols; Protein Conformation, beta-Strand; Protein Stability; Proteins; Proteolysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031787781

The purpose of this research was to determine if and how U.S. commercial construction companies utilize personality profiles in their employee retention processes. A survey was randomly sent to 235 of the top 400 commercial construction companies in the United States to determine if these companies were using assessments, and if it had any effect on the turnover within these companies. Interviews were conducted over the phone with human resources representatives from these companies, and responses were sorted into similar themes and ideas using qualitative pattern coding techniques. Of the 78 responding companies, one-third were using employee personality profiles within their business practices.

Two MPC controllers are compared against two well-tuned PID controllers to obtain a direct comparison of MPC and current FSW controllers. One MPC controller uses a first-order plus dead-time (FOPDT) model derived from a simplified conduction-advection view of the stir zone. The other MPC controller uses the Hybrid Heat Source model that describes heat conduction in the plate and tool. At quasi steady-state conditions, all four controllers can easily hold temperature within 2 °C of the setpoint in the absence of large disturbances. Once the weld is past the initial traverse, the FOPDT controller is superior to the Hybrid Heat Source controller with regards to modeled-disturbance rejection and setpoint changes. The FOPDT controller is competitive with well-tuned PID controllers in this region of the weld. During the initial traverse, the Hybrid Heat Source controller and PID controller with regulator gains were able to control temperature within 5 °C of the setpoint, compared to a typical deviation of 20–30 °C when uncontrolled. During this period, the FOPDT controller and PID controller with servo gains could not maintain satisfactory temperature control. MPC is demonstrated to be a viable control method for FSW. Temperature control before reaching steady state for both MPC and PID is shown to be feasible, but more difficult than for steady state. Recommendations are given for when each controller might be preferred in various circumstances, based upon the results shown herein. © 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Friction stir processing; Friction stir welding; Heat source method; Model predictive control; PID; Temperature control; Temperature models","Disturbance rejection; Electric control equipment; Friction; Friction stir welding; Heat conduction; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Proportional control systems; Research laboratories; Temperature control; Three term control systems; Tribology; Welding; Welds; Comparison of models; First-order plus dead-time models; Friction stir processing; Friction stir welding(FSW); Heat source modeling; Heat sources; Quasi steady state conditions; Temperature models; Controllers",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028440223

This system currently provides data summaries for several performance measures, one of them being turning movement counts collected by microwave sensors. As this system became public, there was a need to evaluate the accuracy of the data placed on the SPMs. A large-scale data collection was carried out to meet this need. Vehicles in the Hi-resolution data from microwave sensors were matched with the vehicles by ground-truth volume count data. Matching vehicles from the microwave sensor data and the ground-truth data manually collected required significant effort. A spreadsheet-based data analysis procedure was developed to carry out the task. A mixed model analysis of variance was used to analyze the effects of the factors considered on turning volume count accuracy. The analysis found that approach volume level and number of approach lanes would have significant effect on the accuracy of turning volume counts but the location of the sensors did not significantly affect the accuracy of turning volume counts. In addition, it was found that the location of lanes in relation to the sensor did not significantly affect the accuracy of lane-by-lane volume counts. This indicated that accuracy analysis could be performed by using total approach volumes without comparing specific turning counts, that is, left-turn, through and right-turn movements. In general, the accuracy of approach volume counts collected by microwave sensors were within the margin of error that traffic engineers could accept. The procedure taken to perform the analysis and a summary of accuracy of volume counts for the factor combinations considered are presented in this paper. © 2017 The Authors","Accuracy; Microwave; Mixed model analysis of variance; Performance; Signal; Traffic volume",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030785041

One cause of this problem is uncertainty regarding the actual requirements of customers in the developing world. This can result when designers, with experience in technologically advanced countries, apply their own value structure to the products they design. Because of the designers’ lack of experience in the culture and environment of the developing world, the actual requirements are only partially known to them. This problem can be mitigated by (i) optimizing product flexibility and adaptability to react to uncertain requirements, and (ii) reducing the most critical uncertainties. The flexibility of a product to adapt to new or changing requirements has been shown to extend the service life of large complex engineered systems (e.g., aircraft carriers, aircraft, communication systems, and space craft). These systems must remain in service for extended periods of time, even though the environments and requirements may change dramatically. Applying these proven techniques to products designed for the developing world can alleviate the problem of uncertain requirements. This paper presents and demonstrates a technique aimed at improving the success of developing world engineering projects. Flexibility and adaptability minimize the impact of uncertainties, and are enabled by numerically optimized amounts of designed-in excess. A sensitivity analysis performed on the system model helps the designer prioritize the set of uncertain requirements and parameters for refinement. The technique is demonstrated in the design of a cookstove intended for use in the developing world. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.","Adaptability; Developing world; Evolvability; Excess; Improved cookstove; Reconfigurability; Reconfigure; System design","Aircraft carriers; Aircraft communication; Developing countries; Sensitivity analysis; Systems analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptability; Developing world; Evolvability; Excess; Improved cookstove; Reconfigurability; Reconfigure; Product design",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015871762

The aircraft was built for the SAE Aero East Competition 2017 hosted in Lakeland, Florida. The objective is to design an all-electric aircraft optimized to carry as much weight as possible, while also minimizing the empty weight of the aircraft capable of successfully completing a flight circuit. A flight circuit is defined as flying completely around two safety cones for a total distance of about 726ft. The challenge has provided the team with the opportunity to improve design and manufacturing skills, while also gaining experience in real life engineering challenges. As a result, the team greatly increased their knowledge of aeronautical design and manufacturing. BYU-Idaho has developed a balsa/plywood carbon fiber reinforced fixed wing aircraft weighing approximately.7lbs, capable of carrying more than 4lbs. When configured for flight, its wings span 60in, and an overall length of 20.8in. Its wing can be broken down into three 20in segments. The aircraft is easily transported in a 6in diameter tube that is 20.3in in length. In order to maximize interior space and manufacturability, the fuselage was not streamlined. Aerodynamic advantages gained from streamlining were considered negligible. The three wing segments are made out of balsa wood ribs attached to a carbon fiber balsa wood composite spar. © Copyright 2017 SAE International.",,"Aircraft; Brakes; Manufacture; Wood; Aeronautical design; All-electric aircraft; Carbon fiber reinforced; Engineering challenges; Interior space; Manufacturability; Manufacturing skills; Total distances; Fixed wings",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029028172

In this paper we demonstrate that a custom digital light processor stereolithographic (DLP-SLA) 3D printer and a specifically-designed, low cost, custom resin can readily achieve flow channel cross sections as small as 18 μm × 20 μm. Our 3D printer has a projected image plane resolution of 7.6 μm and uses a 385 nm LED, which dramatically increases the available selection of UV absorbers for resin formulation compared to 3D printers with 405 nm LEDs. Beginning with 20 candidate absorbers, we demonstrate the evaluation criteria and process flow required to develop a high-resolution resin. In doing so, we introduce a new mathematical model for characterizing the resin optical penetration depth based only on measurement of the absorber's molar absorptivity. Our final resin formulation uses 2-nitrophenyl phenyl sulfide (NPS) as the UV absorber. We also develop a novel channel narrowing technique that, together with the new resin and 3D printer resolution, enables small flow channel fabrication. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by fabricating 3D serpentine flow channels 41 mm long in a volume of only 0.12 mm3, and by printing high aspect ratio flow channels &lt;25 μm wide and 3 mm tall.

Nine subjects (5 male, 4 female) walked on a force-instrumented treadmill at 1.34 m/s for 120 s each while wearing a shoe that was instrumented with four NCPF sensors. GRF data, measured via the treadmill, and sensor data, measured via the NCPF inserts, were used in a tenfold cross validation process to calibrate a separate model for each individual. The calibration model estimated average anterior–posterior, mediolateral and vertical GRF with mean average errors (MAE) of 6.52 N (2.14%), 4.79 N (6.34%), and 15.4 N (2.15%), respectively. Two additional models were created using the sensor data from all subjects and subject demographics. A tenfold cross validation process for this combined data set resulted in models that estimated average anterior–posterior, mediolateral and vertical GRF with less than 8.16 N (2.41%), 6.63 N (7.37%), and 19.4 N (2.31%) errors, respectively. Intra-subject estimates based on the model had a higher accuracy than inter-subject estimates, likely due to the relatively small subject cohort used in creating the model. The novel NCPF sensors demonstrate the ability to accurately estimate 3D GRF during human movement outside of the traditional biomechanics laboratory setting. © 2017, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Foam sensor; Functional data analysis; Gait analysis; Ground reaction force; Nanocomposite; Wearable sensor","Biophysics; Foams; Gait analysis; Nanocomposites; Sporting goods; Average errors; Calibration model; Cross validation; Functional data analysis; Ground reaction forces; Human movements; Human walking; Novel nanocomposites; Wearable sensors; adult; Article; biosensor; body height; body mass; calibration; exercise intensity; female; gait; ground reaction force; human; human experiment; male; measurement accuracy; nanocomposite piezo responsive foam sensor; normal human; priority journal; shoe; three dimensional imaging; treadmill; validation process; walking; young adult; biological model; clinical trial; physiology; walking; nanocomposite; Adult; Female; Gait; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Nanocomposites; Walking",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019213400

Evaporative coolers, an energy-efficient type of air conditioner used in dry climates, are a potential source of indoor endotoxins; however, this association is largely unstudied. We collected settled dust biannually from four locations in homes with evaporative coolers (n=18) and central air conditioners (n=22) in Utah County, Utah (USA), during winter (Jan-Apr) and summer (Aug-Sept), 2014. Dust samples (n=281) were analyzed by the Limulus amebocyte lysate test. Housing factors were measured by survey, and indoor temperature and relative humidity measures were collected during both seasons. Endotoxin concentrations (EU/mg) were significantly higher in homes with evaporative coolers from mattress and bedroom floor samples during both seasons. Endotoxin surface loads (EU/m2) were significantly higher in homes with evaporative coolers from mattress and bedroom floor samples during both seasons and in upholstered furniture during winter. For the nine significant season-by-location comparisons, EU/mg and EU/m2 were approximately three to six times greater in homes using evaporative coolers.

Using flexures to achieve motion presents challenges, three of which are considered in this work. First, compliant mechanisms generally perform inadequately in compression. Second, for a 690 deg range of motion desired for each jaw, the bending stresses in the flexures are prohibitive considering materials used in current instruments. Third, for cables attached at fixed points on the mechanism, the mechanical advantage will vary considerably during actuation.

By comparing models from the competition to the same model in a single-user CAD environment, it is seen that use of a MUCAD system can significantly increase the value-added per unit of calendar time for a modeling effort. An investigation was also made into the causes of the performance differences among the various MUCAD teams which participated in the competition. Analysis of the results shows that teams that encouraged effective forms of communication and teams whose members scored similarly on the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (PSVT:R) performed better than other teams.

The aims of this study were to explore the relationship between cam morphology and dGEMRIC values, and to explore whether baseline dGEMRIC can predict the development of radiographic hip osteoarthritis. Methods Prospective cohort (SibKids) study with clinical, radiographic, and MRI assessment at baseline and five-year follow-up (n = 34). The dGEMRIC values of cartilage regions were correlated with measures of cam morphology. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to baseline variables to predict radiographic loss of joint space width. Results Superolateral acetabular cartilage dGEMRIC values were significantly lower in participants with cam morphology (P < 0.001), defined as an alpha angle greater than 60°. There was a negative correlation between alpha angle and the dGEMRIC value of adjacent acetabular cartilage. This relationship was strongest superoanteriorly (r = −0.697 P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between baseline dGEMRIC and the magnitude of joint space width narrowing (r = 0.398 P = 0.030). ROC analysis of combined baseline variables (positive impingement test, alpha angle, dGEMRIC ratio) gave an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.75 for predicting joint space width narrowing greater than 0.5 mm within 5 years. Conclusions The size and position of cam morphology determines the severity and location of progressive cartilage damage, supporting the biomechanical aetiology of femoroacetabular impingement. Baseline dGEMRIC is able to predict the development of radiographic osteoarthritis.

Incorporating human knowledge in unsupervised learning is a promising approach to create high-quality topic models. Existing interactive systems and modeling algorithms support a wide range of refinement operations to express feedback. However, these systems’ interactions are primarily driven by algorithmic convenience, ignoring users who may lack expertise in topic modeling. To better understand how non-expert users understand, assess, and refine topics, we conducted two user studies—an in-person interview study and an online crowdsourced study. These studies demonstrate a disconnect between what non-expert users want and the complex, low-level operations that current interactive systems support. In particular, our findings include: (1) analysis of how non-expert users perceive topic models; (2) characterization of primary refinement operations expected by non-expert users and ordered by relative preference; (3) further evidence of the benefits of supporting users in directly refining a topic model; (4) design implications for future human-in-the-loop topic modeling interfaces. © 2017","Mixed-initiative interaction; Topic modeling; User study","Hardware; Design implications; Human-in-the-loop; Interactive system; Mixed-initiative interactions; Model algorithms; Refinement operations; Topic Modeling; User study; Engineering",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016065365

Wearable tremor-suppressing devices could provide an alternative to medication and surgery. Multiple research groups have developed orthotic prototypes to low-pass filter tremor, but these devices have not yet been optimized for in-vivo use.

While cavity dynamics has been studied for over a century, this work focuses on the water entry characteristics of deformable elastomeric spheres, which has not been studied. Upon free surface impact, an elastomeric sphere deforms significantly, giving rise to large-scale material oscillations within the sphere resulting in unique nested cavities. We study these phenomena experimentally with high-speed imaging and image processing techniques. The water entry behaviour of deformable spheres differs from rigid spheres because of the pronounced deformation caused at impact as well as the subsequent material vibration. Our results show that this deformation and vibration can be predicted from material properties and impact conditions. Additionally, by accounting for the sphere deformation in an effective diameter term, we recover previously reported characteristics for time to cavity pinch off and hydrodynamic force coefficients for rigid spheres. Our results also show that velocity change over the first oscillation period scales with the dimensionless ratio of material shear modulus to impact hydrodynamic pressure. Therefore, we are able to describe the water entry characteristics of deformable spheres in terms of material properties and impact conditions. © 2017 Cambridge University PressÂ.","aerodynamics; flow-structure interactions; interfacial flows (free surface)","Aerodynamics; Air; Deformation; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Image processing; Shear flow; Dimensionless ratios; Effective diameter; Flow-structure interaction; High speed imaging; Hydrodynamic forces; Impact hydrodynamic pressure; Interfacial flow (free surface); Oscillation periods; Spheres; aerodynamics; deformation; fluid mechanics; free surface flow; impact; interface; rigidity; sphere",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023752137

Additionally, modeling the thermal properties of materials requires knowledge of the possible ways of displacing the atoms. One solution to finding all symmetrically unique configurations and displacements is to generate the complete list of possible configurations and remove those that are symmetrically equivalent. This approach, however, suffers from a combinatorial explosion when the supercell size is large, when there are more than two atom types, or when there are many displaced atoms. This problem persists even when there are only a relatively small number of unique arrangements that survive the elimination process. Here, we extend an existing algorithm to include the extra configurational degrees of freedom from the inclusion of displacement directions. The algorithm uses group theory and a tree-like data structure to eliminate large classes of configurations, avoiding the typical combinatoric explosion. With this approach we can now enumerate previously inaccessible cases, including atomic displacements. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Derivative superstructures; Displacement patterns; Enumeration","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Group theory; Trees (mathematics); Atomic displacement; Combinatorial explosion; Displacement direction; Displacement patterns; Elimination process; Enumeration; Model alloys; Thermal properties of materials; Atoms",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019067223

Measurement results are compared to numerical simulations and good agreement (3% maximum difference) is achieved. Before performing the efficiency measurements, the chamber configuration was assessed with respect to the Rician $K$ -factor, number of uncorrelated paddle orientations, and coherence bandwidth. We calculated the uncertainty using the NIST microwave uncertainty framework capable of performing parallel sensitivity and Monte Carlo analyses.

FSW joints without macroscopic defects are successfully fabricated for the four different material combinations. The optical microscopy results show that the macroscopic material mixing behaviors of the two dissimilar material combinations during FSW are somewhat different from each other, even though the process responses during joining are not much different.

We then show that our method can adaptively lower commanded joint stiffness which slows the mass flow rate of the leak. This extends the operational life of the robot by decreasing long term error during operation by as much as 50% of the steady state error at the end effector when compared to the same leak if our adaptation method is not used.

During the optimization routine, the manipulator's base position and joint motions are planned simultaneously by strategically moving a set of virtual robot arms (each representing a single configuration in a sequence) branching from a common base to a number of assigned target poses associated with a task. Additional goals (e.g. collision avoidance) and hard constraints, including joint limits are also incorporated. The optimization problem at the core of this method is a quadratic program, allowing constrained high-dimensional problems to be solved in very little time.

The aircraft was built for the SAE Aero East Competition 2017 hosted in Lakeland, Florida. The objective is to design an all-electric aircraft optimized to carry as much weight as possible, while also minimizing the empty weight of the aircraft capable of successfully completing a flight circuit. A flight circuit is defined as flying completely around two safety cones for a total distance of about 726ft. The challenge has provided the team with the opportunity to improve design and manufacturing skills, while also gaining experience in real life engineering challenges. As a result, the team greatly increased their knowledge of aeronautical design and manufacturing. BYU-Idaho has developed a balsa/plywood carbon fiber reinforced fixed wing aircraft weighing approximately.7lbs, capable of carrying more than 4lbs. When configured for flight, its wings span 60in, and an overall length of 20.8in. Its wing can be broken down into three 20in segments. The aircraft is easily transported in a 6in diameter tube that is 20.3in in length. In order to maximize interior space and manufacturability, the fuselage was not streamlined. Aerodynamic advantages gained from streamlining were considered negligible. The three wing segments are made out of balsa wood ribs attached to a carbon fiber balsa wood composite spar. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Aircraft; Manufacture; Wood; Aeronautical design; All-electric aircraft; Carbon fiber reinforced; Engineering challenges; Interior space; Manufacturability; Manufacturing skills; Total distances; Fixed wings",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029386262

This scaffold was fabricated by coating vertically aligned carbon nanotubes in a highly conformal coating of nanocrystalline carbon, applied via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. The coating increases the mechanical stability of the nanotube structure, which provides electrically conductive pathways through the anode. Silicon anodes were fabricated with the monoliths by low pressure chemical vapor infiltration of silicon. This platform allows the carbon and silicon volume fractions to be independently varied in the anode. Anodes with a low silicon content (less than 5% by volume) showed high stability in cycling against lithium with a capacity retention of 89.7% between cycles 2 and 185. Anodes with a high silicon content (∼25% by volume) showed poor capacity retention when the carbon content was low (<40% by volume), and transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated that the anodes failed due to the destruction of the nanocrystalline carbon coating during cycling. However, by increasing the carbon content to ∼60% volume percent in the monolith, capacity retention was substantially stabilized even for anodes with very high silicon loadings. These stabilized electrodes exhibited volumetric capacities as high as ∼1000 mA h/ml and retained over 725 mA h/ml by cycle 100. © 2017 American Vacuum Society.",,"Anodes; Atmospheric pressure; Chemical vapor deposition; Coatings; Electric batteries; Electrodes; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Mechanical stability; Nanocrystalline silicon; Nanocrystals; Nanotubes; Scaffolds; Secondary batteries; Silicon; Transmission electron microscopy; Yarn; Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition; Electrically conductive; High silicon content; Low pressure chemical vapor infiltration; Nanocrystalline carbon; Transmission electron; Vertically aligned carbon nanotube; Volumetric capacity; Silicon batteries",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021718278

The course is part of an overall leadership framework whereby students are introduced to the importance of leadership as freshmen, learn foundational leadership principles as sophomores, and practice these principles as juniors and seniors. The leadership foundations course is required for graduation by 7 of 10 programs within the College of Engineering and Technology. Students external to the college also participate in the course as it fulfills two general education requirements for graduation. As a result, the college teaches approximately 12 sections each academic year averaging 60-80 students per section. Approximately 10-15% of student course participants are external to the college. In this paper a survey is presented of 163 students initially enrolled in the leadership foundations course regarding their perceptions and attitudes towards leadership. Results include a comparison of students who are required to take the course and those for whom it is optional. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups of students except for their expectation regarding workload. The engineering and technology students expected the leadership foundations course to be easier, relative to their other classes, than the nonengineering and technology group. In general, both sets of students had high expectations for the course and expressed positive attitudes towards learning about leadership. For example, students in both groups indicated they felt learning about leadership was somewhat more important than learning the skills of their discipline. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,"Education; Engineering education; Foundations; Teaching; College of Engineering and Technology; Engineering and technology; General education; Leadership principles; Positive attitude; Sophomore-level; Statistically significant difference; Student perceptions; Students",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030572436

This shift in computing expectations focuses on the ability to compute horizontally, performing the same tasks within different computing environments, as opposed to vertically, performing different tasks in the same computing environment. In this paper, we propose a method by which the usability of a given piece of software can be comparatively analyzed across all hardware platforms on which it is available. This methodology is based on the Majrashi and Hamilton's twelve factors of usability and has been extended to include specific applications and metrics for the following computing platforms: desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones. These metrics focus on collecting quantitative data about the usability of each platform. This quantitative data contrasts with recent studies which focus extensively on qualitative data regarding the user experience. Combining these two types of studies will allow researchers to capture a more comprehensive picture of software usability across computing platforms. The methodology has been validated by performing an initial study using the tasks and performance metrics across each of the defined computing platforms. The results from these initial tests have allowed us to make improvements to the testing methodology as well as some hypotheses for further testing. This proposed methodology, when used in conjunction with qualitative research, can provide a reliable approach for cross-platform usability analysis. Some considerations for educational design of cross platform methodology are discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,"Computer hardware; Computer software; Engineering education; Hardware; Laptop computers; Personal computers; Smartphones; Computing environments; Computing hardware; Computing platform; Performance metrics; Qualitative research; Software usabilities; Testing methodology; Usability analysis; Usability engineering",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030555769

Although not exclusive to new faculty, the target audience and predominant attendees, were new faculty from the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines on campus. The three-day workshop focused on basic principles of effective learning and teaching, aligning learning outcomes to assessments and teaching activities, methods for active learning, and strategies for effective classroom presentation. The workshop curriculum was centered around the following goals: 1) promoting broader awareness of alternative teaching strategies for STEM classrooms, 2) increasing faculty comfort level in using alternative teaching strategies, 3) increasing adoption of active learning and other evidence-based pedagogies, 4) building a campus community dedicated to improving teaching, and 5) increasing multi-disciplinary collaborations amongst faculty attendees. The purpose of this paper is to provide an example of a model workshop designed to help new faculty engage students in STEM disciplines, and includes the planning, implementation, and assessment of this workshop. The paper begins by introducing the development of the workshop, including the logic model and assessment plan, the curriculum outline, and preparation processes. The paper also explores the implementation lessons learned. Finally, this paper includes the assessment results of the effectiveness of the workshop in meeting the workshop goals. This includes a preand post-workshop comparison of the participant's attitudes regarding evidence based pedagogies and their perceived competency in using them. This paper is useful for engineering educators in developing teaching expertise, researchers interested in faculty attitudes and perceived competency in using alternate teaching strategies, and faculty and administrators planning to create professional development opportunities to help faculty of all levels become more proficient in evidence-based pedagogies.

To conduct seismic risk assessment studies and to improve resilience of bridges, seismic vulnerability studies are required. The main objective of this study is to construct fragility curves of typical non-skewed highway bridges in Chile. The fragility curves are obtained from an incremental dynamic analysis of a two-dimensional model of the bent cap of a two-span simply supported underpass. As most bridges are constructed with seismic tie-down bars, their constitutive behavior was obtained experimentally. A total of five seismic bar specimens were tested to characterize their cyclic behavior in bridges with and without transverse diaphragms. The incremental dynamic analysis was performed with the two horizontal components of seven seismic records obtained from the Mw 8.8, 2010 Chile earthquake. Additionally, a parametric study is conducted to assess the seismic behavior of bridges with different configurations of seismic bars, with lateral stoppers, and with varying length of the transverse seat width. Results from this study reveal that seismic bars have a limited contribution to the seismic performance of the studied bridge, especially when lateral stoppers are incorporated. Additionally, the transverse seat width is found to be critical to reduce the collapse probability of the superstructure. The provided fragility curves may be used for seismic risk assessment and to evaluate possible improvements in seismic bridge design codes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bearings; Bridge; Damage; Experimental analysis; Fragility; Incremental dynamic analysis; Seismic behavior","Bearings (structural); Bridges; Curves (road); Dynamic analysis; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Losses; Risk assessment; Seismic design; Seismic response; Seismology; Transportation; Damage; Experimental analysis; Fragility; Incremental dynamic analysis; Seismic behavior; Highway bridges; bridge; cyclic loading; damage; dynamic analysis; experimental study; risk assessment; seismic design; seismic response; Chile",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016619056

In this work, over 1000 sets of climate coefficients were developed to separately adjust building heating, cooling, and fan energy use at each weather station in the United States. This paper also presents a robust, standardized weather station mapping based on climate similarity rather than choosing the closest weather station. This proposed simulated-based climate adjustment was validated through testing on several hundreds of thousands of modeled buildings. Results indicated the developed climate coefficients can adjust the climate variations to enable a fair comparison of building energy efficiency. © 2016, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","asset rating; climate normalization; commercial buildings; energy efficiency; energy simulation","Buildings; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Office buildings; Weather information services; Building energy consumption; Building energy efficiency; climate normalization; Commercial building; Energy simulation; Heating and cooling; Normalization methods; Standard operating conditions; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014655709

To develop an accurate and efficient methodology for this class of problems, we present algorithms for local h-adaptivity of hierarchical B-splines to be utilized in isogeometric analysis. We extend Bézier projection, an efficient quadrature-free local projection technique, to the hierarchical setting. In this case, extraction operators may not be invertible. To address this issue we develop a multi-level reconstruction operator which maintains the locality properties of the projection. We also introduce a balance parameter to control the overlap of hierarchical functions leading to improved numerical conditioning. We apply our algorithms to the simulation of localized prostate cancer growth. We model this disease using the phase-field method and a set of diffusion–reaction equations to account for the dynamics of nutrients and a key biomarker termed Prostate Specific Antigen. Our results include examples on simple 2D and 3D domains and a more compelling tissue-scale, patient-specific simulation, which is run over a prostate anatomy extracted from medical images.

We find that while increasing the number of UAVs initially has a more-than-linear effect on the reported separation incidents, this effect quickly levels off due to carrying capacity limitations. We also find that while different behaviors (objectives and movement patterns) of UAVs affects the locations of the separation incidents, the number of separation incidents is not strongly influenced by these changes. We then explore the implementation of separation-assurance mechanisms using varying levels of information, and examine effects on the emergent behavior. © 2017 IEEE.","high-density; modeling and simulation; Multi-agent modeling; UAV systems; unmanned aerial vehicles","Autonomous agents; Separation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicles; Air delivery systems; Capacity limitation; Design and implementations; Model and simulation; Multi-Agent Model; Separation assurances; UAV systems; Unmanned aerial vehicle systems; Multi agent systems",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021453322

This differs from the common procedure of inferring hypothetical microproperties by fitting to macroscopic behavior using an assumed micro-to-macrolaw. The bottom-up approach allows the assessment of the law itself by comparing RVE-predicted mechanical behavior with independent macroscopic measurements, thus revealing the nature of the controlling micromechanisms. An RVE for DP980 steel was constructed using actual microproperties. Finite element (FE) simulations of elastic-plastic transitions were compared with independent loading-unloading-loading and compression-tension experiments.

These comparisons led to following conclusions: 1) While a constitutive model that ignores elastic interaction of defects can be fit to macroscopic or microscopic behavior, it cannot represent both accurately, 2) Elastic interactions among dislocations are the predominant source of nonlinearity in the nominally-elastic region (i.e. at stresses below the standard yield stress), and 3) Continuum stress inhomogeneity arising from the hard martensite / soft ferrite microstructure has a minor role in the observed transitional nonlinearity in the absence of discrete dislocation interactions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crystal plasticity; Dislocation pile-up; Dual phase steel; Representative volume element; Superdislocation","Constitutive models; Continuum mechanics; Elastoplasticity; Piles; Plasticity; Unloading; Volume measurement; Yield stress; Crystal plasticity; Dislocation pileup; Dual-phase steel; Representative volume element (RVE); Superdislocations; Dislocations (crystals)",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017454564

It uses measurement data to devise a family of reduced order nonlinear models while retaining physical interpretability of parameters and equations. The manifold boundary approximation method (MBAM) uses the Fisher information matrix calculated from measurements to identify the least relevant parameter combination in the original model. Next, it numerically constructs a geodesic on the corresponding statistical manifold originating from the initial parameters in the least relevant parameter direction until a manifold boundary is found. MBAM then identifies a limiting approximation in the mathematical form of the model and removes one parameter combination. The simplified model is recalibrated by fitting its behavior to that of the original model, and the process is repeated as appropriate.

Here, we rationally designed a pathology-targeted cell delivery strategy leveraging injectable micro-scaffolds as cell-loading capsule and endogenous tissue transglutaminase (TGase) at lesion site as adhesive. Up-regulated TGase post-liver injury catalyzed chemical bonding between the glutamine and lysine residues on liver surface and micro-scaffolds both ex vivo and in vivo, facilitating sufficient adhesion on the pathological liver. Upon intraperitoneal injection, Mesenchymal Stem Cell-loaded capsules, exhibiting cell protection from shear-induced damage and post-transplantation anoikis, adhered to the CCl4-treated liver with a hundred-fold improvement in targeting efficiency (70.72%) compared to free-cell injection, which dramatically improved mice survival (33.3% vs. 0% for free-cell therapy) even with low-dosage treatment.

These silks include the major and minor ampullate silks of the Nephila clavipes spider, and a synthetic spider silk fiber made from recombinant dragline silk proteins purified from transgenic goats’ milk. Two complementary measurement techniques are employed in the thermal characterization of these microscale single fibers for self-verification. One is the transient electrothermal technique (TET) and the other is the 3ω method. Experimental measurements indicate that thermal properties of the dragline silk are very close to those of the minor ampullate silk, whereas the ones for the synthetic silk are much lower due in part to its low crystallinity.

To clarify, optimally suppressing tremor requires a knowledge of the mechanical origin, propagation, and distribution of tremor throughout the upper limb. Here we present the first systematic investigation of how tremor propagates between the shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist. We simulated tremor propagation using a linear, time-invariant, lumped-parameter model relating joint torques and the resulting joint displacements. The model focused on the seven main degrees of freedom from the shoulder to the wrist and included coupled joint inertia, damping, and stiffness. We deliberately implemented a simple model to focus first on the most basic effects. Simulating tremorogenic joint torque as a sinusoidal input, we used the model to establish fundamental principles describing how input parameters (torque location and frequency) and joint impedance (inertia, damping, and stiffness) affect tremor propagation. We expect that the methods and principles presented here will serve as the groundwork for future refining studies to understand the origin, propagation, and distribution of tremor throughout the upper limb in order to enable the future development of optimal tremor-suppressing devices. © 2016, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Essential tremor; Frequency response; Impedance; Parkinson’s disease; System dynamics; Tremor suppression","Damping; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electric impedance; Frequency response; Stiffness; Essential tremor; Fundamental principles; Lumped parameter modeling; Movement disorders; Simple modeling; Sinusoidal input; System Dynamics; Tremor suppression; Joints (anatomy); Article; device therapy; elbow; forearm; impedance; joint; limb tremor; mathematical model; rigidity; shoulder; simulation; torque; upper limb; wrist; biological model; human; pathophysiology; tremor; upper limb; Humans; Models, Neurological; Tremor; Upper Extremity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85003894392

In other words, all geometric quantities appearing in the blended theory are evaluated exactly and no approximations are employed. The blended approach allows higher-order shell theories, like Kirchhoff-Love, to be combined with Reissner-Mindlin shell formulations, which have rotational degrees of freedom. In this way, rotations can be employed only where needed to simplify shell modeling such as at kinks and intersections. Away from these regions shear locking free formulations can be employed to improve robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. We compare our approach to standard shell elements commonly used in industry on several benchmarks to explore the behavior of the element. We then model an inner car hood to demonstrate our ability to handle complex CAD geometry in a simple manner without geometry cleanup and mesh generation steps.

We present and evaluate a set of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), that are designed to allow a human to express intent by expressing desirable tradeoffs. The GUIs require an algorithm that identifies the set of Pareto optimal solutions to the multi-objective decision problem, which means that all the solutions are equally good in the sense that there are no other solutions better for every objective. Given the Pareto set, the GUIs provide different ways for a human to express intent by exploring tradeoffs between objectives; once a tradeoff is selected, the solution is chosen. The GUI designs are applied to interactive human-robot path-selection for a robot in an urban environment, but they can be applied to other tradeoff problems. A user study evaluates GUI designs by requiring users to select a tradeoff that satisfies a specified mission intent.

This paper presents a novel approach that involves treating the team as a moldable volume, in which deformations of the volume correspond to changes in team shape. The team possesses a level of autonomy that allows the team to travel to and surround buildings of interest in a patrol and cordon scenario. During surround mode, the operator explores or manipulates the team shape to create desired formations around a building. A spacing interaction method also allows the operator to adjust how robots are spaced within the current shape. Separate haptic feedback is developed for each method to allow the operator to ""feel"" the shape or spacing manipulation. During travel mode, the operator chooses desired travel locations and receives feedback to help identify how and where the team travels. Results from a user study suggest that haptic feedback significantly improves operator performance in a reconnaissance task when task demand is higher, but may slightly increase operator workload. In the context of the experimental setup, these results suggest that haptic feedback may contribute to heads-up control of a team of autonomous robots.

Neither sustainable reservoir life spans nor intergenerational equity is achieved through conventional cost-benefit analyses (CBAs), which render all benefits and costs projected to occur more than several decades into a project as negligible. Consequently, future costs, including dam decommissioning or retrofitting with sediment management facilities, would be regarded as nonfactors in an analysis. CBAs have also historically failed to account for infrastructure and environmental impacts of sedimentation over time. Alternatives to the traditional application of the CBA do exist, however, such as dam owners instituting retirement funds or insurance policies, beneficiaries paying for rehabilitation or maintenance, and economists incorporating infrastructure damages and potentially logistic discount rates into their analyses. A brief case study of Gavins Point Dam shows that available information on damages due to a lack of sediment management account for 70% of the actual construction cost and would likely exceed construction costs if all damage information were available. By integrating these alternatives, economic analyses for reservoirs will be more accurate, reservoir life spans will be more sustainable, profits will be extended indefinitely, and the economic burdens placed on future generations will be lessened. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Costs; Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Insurance; Reconstruction (structural); Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Sediments; Sustainable development; Water supply; Water supply systems; Construction costs; Dam decommissioning; Damage information; Future generations; Insurance policies; Intergenerational equity; Reservoir capacity; Sediment management; Cost benefit analysis; cost-benefit analysis; dam repair; decommissioning; economic analysis; infrastructural development; reservoir; sedimentation; sustainability; Gavins Point Dam; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014415504

For infrastructure projects, the FEP process assists in identifying and mitigating risks stemming from issues such as right-of-way concerns, utility adjustments, environmental hazards, logistic problems, and permitting requirements. The authors have developed a novel risk management tool, called the project definition rating index (PDRI) for infrastructure projects, which can be used to identify and address these issues systematically and in a structured manner. Input from 64 industry professionals representing over 30 organizations was used in the development of the tool. In addition to a usable definition for infrastructure in the context of the built environment, a finite and specific list of issues related to scope definition of infrastructure projects was developed with this industry input. Data from 26 completed or in-process projects are given. Results show that the PDRI assessment score is indicative of the current level of scope definition for sample projects and corresponds to project performance. Findings support the hypothesis that projects with improved early understanding of scope definition elements showed improved project outcomes; infrastructure projects with low PDRI scores (well defined) outperformed projects with high PDRI scores. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by specifically identifying those FEP elements that are critical to infrastructure projects. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Front-end planning (FEP); Planning; Project definition rating index (PDRI); Risk management; Scope definition","Planning; Project management; Rating; Environmental hazards; Front-end planning; Industry professionals; Infrastructure project; Project definition rating index (PDRI); Project performance; Scope definition; Structured approach; Risk management",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013052850

We evaluated point estimates and prediction intervals of outage predictions for both models using high-resolution weather, infrastructure, and land use data for 89 storm events (including hurricanes, blizzards, and thunderstorms). We found that spatially BART predicted more accurate point estimates than QRF. However, QRF produced better prediction intervals for high spatial resolutions (2-km grid cells and towns), while BART predictions aggregated to coarser resolutions (divisions and service territory) more effectively. We also found that the predictive accuracy was dependent on the season (e.g., tree-leaf condition, storm characteristics), and that the predictions were most accurate for winter storms. Given the merits of each individual model, we suggest that BART and QRF be implemented together to show the complete picture of a storm's potential impact on the electric distribution network, which would allow for a utility to make better decisions about allocating prestorm resources. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis","Bayesian additive regression trees; critical infrastructure outage modeling; electric distribution network; quantile regression forests; weather hazards","Electric network parameters; Electric power distribution; Forecasting; Forestry; Land use; Meteorological problems; Outages; Regression analysis; Storms; Bayesian additive regression trees; High spatial resolution; Individual modeling; Outage models; Predictive accuracy; Predictive modeling; Quantile regression; Weather hazards; Knowledge based systems; Bayesian analysis; hazard assessment; land use; numerical model; software; spatial resolution; thunderstorm; Connecticut; United States; article; forest; grid cell; human cell; hurricane; land use; plant leaf; prediction; remission; winter",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978245793

An extensive and detailed experimental program has been conducted on three-block high stack-bonded prisms, built using a combination of one hollow block type and three mortars with different strengths. Based on the results of the experiments, masonry failure was assessed. The main conclusion of this is that the mortar in all cases governs the masonry failure mechanism. The ratio between the masonry and block moduli of elasticity, which can be used as a measure of loss of stiffness, indicates that masonry built with a strong mortar behaves almost as a homogenous material. The typical failure mode observed during testing for this type of masonry was due to tensile stresses developed in the block. A crack developed at and propagated instantly through the block face until reaching the mortar bed joint; the crack then propagated through the head joint causing a localized split at the interface between block and mortar. For masonry built with two different weak mortars, as the stress/strength ratio increased, the ratio between the masonry and mortar moduli of elasticity decreased to 0.32 and 0.55, for the weak and the weaker mortar respectively. The observed failure mode, however, was independent of how weak the mortar was since, for both cases, the masonry failed due to localized mortar crushing. Another conclusion from the study presented herein is that a robust and reliable prediction of the masonry compressive strength requires the use of the nonlinear stress-strain relationship of the component materials. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Failure modes; Masonry prisms; Nonlinear behavior; Stiffness ratio; Stress-strain relationship","Compressive strength; Concrete construction; Concretes; Cracks; Elasticity; Failure (mechanical); Failure modes; Mortar; Prisms; Stiffness; Stress-strain curves; Tensile testing; Concrete masonry prisms; Experimental program; Masonry prisms; Nonlinear behavior; Nonlinear stress-strain relationship; Stiffness ratios; Stress-strain behaviors; Stress-strain relationships; Masonry materials",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008179605

As the base material approached the probe, grains were compressed, forming compression zone (CPZ). The grains evolved to fine equiaxed grains mainly through discontinue dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) and twining as it approached the tool. As material in MFZ rotated around the probe, the fraction of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) was reduced, the ratio of twin boundaries increased, and the grain size distribution became wider, while the average grain size was fairly constant despite the increase in strain. After the material was deposited behind the probe, the grains began to grow. Deformation caused by tool shoulder disrupted the twin boundaries and generated some segments of LAGBs. In the post-weld zone, some LAGBs disappeared and new twin boundaries developed as a result of elevated temperatures. The B component {112} 〈110〉 was developed and was sustained in the MFZ with its shear direction being consisted with the local probe rotation.

Streamlines of the Poynting vector field can be used to understand electromagnetic energy flow near linear and aperture antennas. Poynting streamlines provide a way to understand and guide the design of superdirective antennas. Directivity-enhancing screens that attract Poynting streamlines and increase the aperture efficiency of a horn antenna to almost 200% are studied. Superdirective antennas generally have limited practical value due to poor radiation efficiency, narrow bandwidth, and extreme sensitivity to fabrication errors. We show that these limitations can be mitigated by using metal-only structures that are optimized for broadband operation.

In the former, F→ 2 +, limit, the shallow water equations are formally approximated by a Korteweg-de Vries/Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KdV–KS) equation that is a singular perturbation of the standard Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation modeling horizontal shallow water flow. Our main analytical result is to rigorously validate this formal limit, showing that stability as F→ 2 + is equivalent to stability of the corresponding KdV–KS waves in the KdV limit. Together with recent results obtained for KdV–KS by Johnson–Noble–Rodrigues–Zumbrun and Barker, this gives not only the first rigorous verification of stability for any single viscous St. Venant roll wave, but a complete classification of stability in the weakly unstable limit. In the remainder of the paper, we investigate numerically and analytically the evolution of the stability diagram as Froude number increases to infinity.

Deposits of heavy fuel oil ash were created in the Turbine Accelerated Deposition Facility (TADF) at Brigham Young University under gas turbine-related conditions. Ash was produced by burning heavy fuel oil in a downward-fired combustor and collecting the ash from the exhaust stream. The mass mean ash particle diameter from these tests was 33 microns. This ash was then introduced into the TADF and entrained in a hot gas flow that varied from 1088 to 1206°C. The gas and particle velocity was accelerated to over 200 m/s in these tests. This particle-laden hot gas stream then impinged on a nickel base superalloy metal coupon approximately 3 cm in diameter, and an ash deposit formed on the coupon. Sulfur dioxide was introduced to the system to achieve 1.1 mol% SO2 in the exhaust stream in order to simulate SO2 levels in turbines currently burning heavy fuel oil. The ash deposits were collected, and the capture efficiency, surface roughness, and deposit composition were measured. The deposits were then washed with deionized water, dried, and underwent the same analysis. It was found that, as the gas temperature increased, there was no effect on capture efficiency and the post-wash roughness of the samples decreased. Washing aided in the removal of sulfur, magnesium, potassium, and calcium.

The best experimental methodologies presented so far involve light transmission and thus only work for fiberglass reinforcements. An experimental methodology is presented in this paper, in which a proper lighting scheme allows for in situ photography of bubbles during liquid composite molding of carbon reinforcements. The resulting images were processed using image analysis software to identify key parameters such as grey level threshold, and size and circularity limits, which best allow for automated identification of bubbles in the images. No script achieved complete identification of all of the bubbles, but a methodology was developed and implemented to iterate the analysis parameters, evaluate the resulting bubble identification performance, and identify a range of analysis parameters that would provide the best possible results for automated in situ void detection. © 2017 International Committee on Composite Materials.

The tracking method uses a monocular camera and makes no assumptions on the shape of the terrain or the target motion. The UAV runs two cascaded estimators. The first is an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is responsible for tracking the UAV's state, such as position and velocity relative to a fixed frame. The second estimator is an EKF that is responsible for estimating a fixed number of landmarks within the camera's field of view. Landmarks are parameterized by a quaternion associated with bearing from the camera's optical axis and an inverse distance parameter. The bearing quaternion allows for a minimal representation of each landmark's direction and distance, a filter with no singularities, and a fast update rate due to few trigonometric functions. Three methods for estimating the ground target positions are demonstrated: the first uses the landmark estimator directly on the targets, the second computes the target depth with a weighted average of converged landmark depths, and the third extends the target's measured bearing vector to intersect a ground plane approximated from the landmark estimates. Simulation results show that the third target estimation method yields the most accurate results. © 2017, Institute of Navigation.",,"Aircraft detection; Antennas; Cameras; Global positioning system; Inverse problems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Distance parameter; Minimal representation; Monocular cameras; Multiple grounds; Reference frame; Target estimations; Trigonometric functions; Weighted averages; Extended Kalman filters",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047864637

The educational goal is for students to gain confidence in their ability to gather insights through interviews, observations, and participatory experiences; simplify this data down to a handful of experience drivers; and use these drivers to create a framework that provides new insight for the more mature design exploration required in the third-year studios. The introduction of this skill earlier than immediately necessary brings tradeoffs. Disconnected from an actual sponsored project, the importance of the skill is not completely evident to the second-year students. However, in course evaluations, students comment that introducing the skill and practicing it earlier than required, helps their initial third-year product studio performance and decrease stress.

Project-based learning is designed to provide students with an opportunity to engage in authentic problem finding and solving. Students often become very involved with the specifics of their project without always noticing what they are learning. As such, it becomes essential to engage them in reflection during the process and at the completion of the project. A constellation of formative and summative assessment activities that include self, group, and instructor, can aid the learner in this contemplation. We propose that public assessment in the form of a student-run sale can provide distinctive feedback to students. Our experience with student-run retail sales over multiple years has lead us to identify some unique characteristics of this type of public assessment. These include a positive effect on student motivation, independent validation in a face-to-face setting, and providing direct consumer feedback to students.

Fire spread in live chamise and big sagebrush shrubs was measured in an open-roofed wind tunnel, which was used as the basis to develop the current model. Shrub geometry was modeled by coupling a Lindenmayer-systems (L-systems) approach with terrestrial LiDAR scan data. Wind speed was held constant at 1.4 m/s. Species specific correlations for physical properties and combustion characteristics of individual fuel element were incorporate in this model. Modeling results compared well with measured time-dependent fire behavior. Variations in local fuel density affected flame spread more than the overall fuel bed density.

Coal combustion simulations depend on the particle physics to predict product compositions, temperatures, energy outputs, and other useful information. The focus of this paper is to improve the accuracy of devolatilization submodels, to be used in conjunction with other particle physics models. Many large simulations today rely on inaccurate assumptions about particle compositions, including that the volatiles that are released during pyrolysis are of the same elemental composition as the char particle. Another common assumption is that the char particle can be approximated by pure carbon. These assumptions will lead to inaccuracies in the overall simulation. There are many factors that influence pyrolysis product composition, including parent coal composition, pyrolysis conditions (including particle temperature history and heating rate), and others. All of these factors are incorporated into the correlations to predict the elemental composition of the major pyrolysis products, including coal tar, char, and light gases. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

FRP rebar is generally as strong as steel rebar, but less susceptible to corrosion, providing a significant advantage over traditional steel reinforcement in concrete structures. In this study, a variety of different design configurations of carbon/epoxy composite cylindrical rebar rods were manufactured, embedded in concrete, and tested in axial tension to identify the relationships between manufacturing parameters and tensile pull-out strength of the rebar. The rebar was produced by combining multiple tows of carbon/epoxy prepreg to form the core of cylindrical rods which were consolidated using various spirally-wound consolidation fibers. The rods were cured at 121 degrees Celsius as specified by the material manufacturer, TCR Composites. The manufactured rods were approximately 10.4 mm in diameter. Primary variables investigated included the consolidation fiber material (aramid, fiberglass and basalt), prepreg vs. dry consolidation tows, the number of tows used to consolidate the rebar (i.e., the size of tows used to consolidate the rebar). Larger consolidation tows were created by braiding three smaller tows together. The consolidation tows also served the purpose of providing the rebar with ribs similar to those on steel rebar to improve bonding. Select rebar samples were subsequently coated with sand to increase rebar surface roughness for improved bonding with concrete. The rebar was cast in 200 mm × 200 mm × 200 mm concrete cubes to investigate bond strength. The strength of the bond between concrete and FRP rebar was investigated using the pull-out test detailed by ACI 440.3R-12. A test fixture was manufactured to enable testing using a standard tensile testing machine. Standard 12.7 mm diameter steel rebar and a commercially comparable fiberglass rebar were also tested to provide baseline values. Results showed that the bond strength was below 344 MPa (50 ksi) when dry winding was used regardless of whether a single or a multiple tow consolidation bundle was used. Prepreg consolidation combined with sand resulted in a bond strength of 478 MPa (69.3 ksi), comparable to steel at 464 MPa (67.2 ksi). The results demonstrated that consolidating the rods with a wet tow resulted in a rebar which bonded better with concrete than using a dry tow. During testing, it was discovered that dry consolidating materials would easily strip off the rod due to poor bonding. Sand was shown to significantly increase the bond strength of the composite rebar, by more than 30 percent. This study provides the basis for a proposed new low-cost manufacturing method for composite rebar as structural reinforcement in concrete. These preliminary results allowed for a test matrix to be set up where FRP rebar bond strength could be investigated in detail using higher quality samples and more controlled parameters. © 2017 The Composites and Advanced Materials Expo (CAMX).

A comparison of highly forward scattering cases for two particle sizes (25μm vs. 75μm) revealed a significant difference in incident heat flux maximum (25%).

Flame characteristics such as flame length and flame width were measured for both single and merged flames. Our data shows that by altering the separation distance between felts in both vertical and horizontal directions, flame area, height and width vary to a large extent. The region of flame merging is mapped in both the horizontal and vertical directions. These data are being used to develop flame-merging correlations as a function of flame spacing, similar to correlations that have been developed for multiple flames in the horizontal plane.","Fires; Flame - merging","Felt; Felts; Fires; Fuels; Heptane; Merging; Combustion model; Different geometry; Flame characteristics; Flame interaction; Growth patterns; Multiple leaves; Separation distances; Vertical direction; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040179488

The code calculates gas temperature and composition, wall heat flux, and wall and refractory temperatures using 1D, equilibrium chemistry and a 3D discrete ordinates radiation solver. Chemistry and temperature calculations are made for a discrete number of axial zones wherein the temperature and species composition are assumed to be uniform. Radiation calculations are performed on a finer grid and assume gray gases. The code was validated by comparing to experimental data obtained from the L1500 Multifuel Furnace. The experimental data were taken from a single oxy-coal combustion experiment with flue gas recirculation run at a firing rate of 880kW and an air-fuel ratio of 3.6. FENICS was able to qualitatively match the wall flux and temperature profiles quite well. The major exception to this being that peak flux cannot accurately be predicted due the assumptions utilized 'smearing' the flame. Quantitatively, FENICS showed good agreement with the data. Wall temperatures were accurate to within 150K (13%) while total wall radiative heat loss was within 4%.

The process is demonstrated for a square-twist mechanism designed using the hinge shift technique for accommodating thickness in origami patterns. A Miura-ori mechanism is also shown in sheet metal.

Mesh refinement in regions of high velocity gradients was shown to be the most critical factor in achieving realistic simulation results. In Case 5 where mesh refinement was focused near the geometric shapes of the cooling tubes and burner tile, insufficient mesh refinement existed in the fuel-air mixing zones around and above the burner to accurately predict fuel jet penetration and fuel-air mixing, resulting in inaccurate predictions for flame shape and heat flux profiles at the cooling tubes. Differences in predicted incident flux, total heat transfer and flame shape between the highest levels of mesh refinement (~2 million cells) between the structured trimmed-cell mesh and the unstructured polyhedral mesh were minimal. At lower mesh levels of 1 million cells, there were slightly greater discrepancies between the structured trimmed-cell mesh and the unstructured polyhedral mesh, particularly with respect to the flame shape and upper furnace flux profile predicted in Case 3. Interestingly, the differences in thermal efficiency and total heat transfer were greater between Case 2 and Case 1 (2 million versus 1 million cells) than between Case 2 and Case 5 (2 million versus 1 million cells with poor refinement). This trend was also observed with Case 4 and Case 3. This suggests both cell count and local mesh refinement are important to achieving accurate combustion predictions, but that there is minimal difference between the results with differing mesh types as long as the cell count and refinement are sufficient to represent the expected jet mixing behavior. These results also suggest that while the flame shape does impact the boundary flux profile as expected, the impact on thermal efficiency may be less well correlated. Thus, total heat transfer results should not be used to assess flame shape behavior; boundary flux profiles provided better correlation to flame shape.",,"Cells; Combustion; Cytology; Efficiency; Enthalpy; Fighter aircraft; Forecasting; Fuel burners; Fuels; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Mixing; Computational mesh; Critical factors; High velocity gradients; Local mesh refinement; Mesh refinement; Polyhedral meshes; Realistic simulation; Thermal efficiency; Mesh generation",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026803213

At the liquid-surface boundary of the spreading thin film, an isotropic hydrodynamic slip and temperature jump are imposed to approximate the SHPo surface boundary condition. Applying an integral analysis within the thin film results in a system of differential equations which are solved numerically to obtain local hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer thicknesses, thin film height, and local and radially averaged heat flux. The classical smooth hydrophobic scenario with no-slip and no-temperature jump showed excellent agreement with previous differential analysis of the same problem. The influence of varying temperature jump length on the local Nusselt number was obtained over a range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Increasing temperature jump length results in a dramatic decrease in the local thermal transport near the impingement point. The greatest decrease occurs at small temperature jump lengths. Further, local and average Nusselt numbers are less influenced by the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers as temperature jump length increases. Overall, variations in the temperature jump length exert much more influence than variations in the hydrodynamic slip length. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Convective heat transfer; Jet impingement; Slip length; Superhydrophobic surface; Temperature jump length","Boundary conditions; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Heat convection; Heat flux; Hydrodynamics; Hydrophobicity; Jets; Liquids; Nusselt number; Polonium compounds; Prandtl number; Sulfur compounds; Surface properties; Thin films; Convective heat transfer; Jet impingement; Slip length; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Temperature jump; Fighter aircraft",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016307195

While atomization is always present for impingement on the hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces at temperatures below the Leidenfrost point, atomization is absent at low Weber numbers and at low excess surface temperatures on the hydrophobic surface. At high surface temperatures, the attraction of vapor bubbles on the hydrophobic surface allows a vapor blanket to form more readily thus leading to Leidenfrost behavior at a much lower temperature than classically observed on a hydrophilic surface. One of the most interesting phenomenon that will be discussed includes what will be described as a “pseudo-Leidenfrost” state for impingement on the superhydrophobic surface. Because water can be suspended at the peaks of the roughness on a superhydrophobic interface, vapor escapes from underneath the droplet thus mimicking Leidenfrost behavior for all excess temperatures. This results in minimal atomization for superhydrophobic impingement over the entire regime explored. Finally, maximum spread diameters for Leidenfrost impingement are tabulated as a function of the Weber number for all surfaces and are shown to be larger on the smooth surfaces than on the textured ones indicating that droplet spreading at the Leidenfrost point is not independent of surface type as previously supposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Boiling; Droplet impingement; Superhydrophobic","Atmospheric temperature; Atomization; Boiling liquids; Drops; Hydrodynamics; Hydrophilicity; Phase interfaces; Surface properties; Wetting; Droplet impingement; Hydrophilic surfaces; Hydrophobic surfaces; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Superhydrophilic surface; Superhydrophobic; Surface temperatures; Water droplet impingement; Hydrophobicity",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009936506

LUVOIR (large, UV-optical-IR telescope) is a potential NASA flagship space-based observatory of the 2020's or 30's. It would utilize the largest mirrors ever flown1. Their reflective coating will almost certainly be aluminum, since such telescopes would profit from truly broad-band mirrors. To achieve reflectance over the broadest band, the top surface of such aluminum mirrors, however, needs to be bare, without the oxide layers that naturally form in air. This will open the 11 to 15 eV band. Since thin aluminum films are largely transparent between 15 and 70 eV an EUV mirror under the aluminum could make EUV bands such as 30.4 nm available for space-based astrophysics without sacrificing mirror IR, visible and UV reflectance. The local space environment for the observatory is sufficiently oxygen-free that the surface should remain bare for decades. We discuss protecting as-deposited aluminum mirrors with robust, oxygenimpenetrable, barrier layers applied in vacuo to the aluminum immediately after deposition and before air contact. The goal is that the barrier could also be cleanly, and relatively easily, removed once the mirror is in space. We propose hydrogen atoms as the means for removing the overcoat, since they can be expected to meet the criteria that the means is gentle enough to not roughen the mirror surface, and does not redeposit material on the mirror or other spacecraft components. We have investigated both organic and inorganic (such as, a-Si) hydrogen-removable films that can be applied to the aluminum immediately after its deposition have been investigated. We also examined the REVAP technique, using Cd and Zn. Agglomeration limited their effectiveness as barrier layers. That and dealing with the reevaporated atoms may limit their utility as barrier materials. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

For small UAS, the need is especially critical because of the clutter and the air-traffic density at low altitudes where they operate. For the community of researchers who are developing SAA technology for small UAS, there is a critical need for a rich, openly-accessible compendium of encounter data with which to develop, test, and evaluate SAA algorithms. In this paper we introduce a publicly available database of small UAS encounter data, the small aircraft flight encounter (SAFE) database, with an initial deposit of 11 flight encounters. In these encounters two target aircraft, a fixed-wing and a multi-rotor are imaged by a separate fixed-wing aircraft carrying two high-definition video cameras and a unique radar unit. The data contain ground-truth navigation estimates for both the target and imaging aircraft. The target aircraft are observed in the video footage but not in the radar imagery; continuing efforts include tuning and refinement of the radar parameters and expansion of the SAFE database to support small UAS SAA technology development. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The life-cycle benefit– cost analysis currently used by the Utah Department of Transportation is similar to the least reliable method. To provide a tool to perform the most reliable method defined by the HSM—the predictive method— this research developed a spreadsheet-based tool to allow department engineers to perform life-cycle benefit–cost analyses for the 11 roadway segment types included in the HSM. The tool can be used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of safety-related improvements identified by the Utah crash prediction model, which was previously developed to identify safety hot spots on the state highway system. The concept and the spreadsheet layout are presented by using the rural two-lane, two-way highway spreadsheet as an example. Then a case of a rural two-lane, two-way highway with two selected countermeasures is presented to demonstrate the use of this spreadsheet to compare their benefit–cost ratios. One important aspect associated with life-cycle benefit–cost analyses of safety-related improvements is the cost of implementing such improvements. Safety-related improvements are often included in larger construction contracts and such costs vary significantly, depending on the way they are included in the larger contracts. Hence, construction costs of safety-related improvements—such as initial cost, periodic rehabilitation cost, and annual maintenance costs—must be prepared outside this spreadsheet by the user. © 2017, SAGE Publications Ltd.

It is a multifaceted industry with unregulated transactions in which illicit behavior can be difficult to detect. The effects of corruption go beyond demoralization associated with bribery, it can lead to substandard quality of infrastructure and insufficient funds available for project maintenance. There are a multitude of reasons identified as possible causes for unethical conduct. A few researchers cited corruption as a result of an unethical decision. Prior research concerning corruption in construction has called for several main strategies: enhanced transparency, ethical codes, project governance, and audit and information technology. However, strategies to combat corruption may not be sufficient. This research first presents an overview of unethical conduct in the industry. Then it examines the ethics in the industry followed by types of relationships and their structure which may be conducive to unethical conduct within the framework of different delivery methods.

Four key parameters were identified as desirable to quantitatively capture distortion transfer, generation and effects on performance: distortion magnitude, shape, severity and phase. A set of distortion descriptors based on Fourier analysis are shown to quantitatively capture distortion magnitude, shape and phase change across bladerows.

The data offered by WDP technology has maximum benefit when applied in an automation system or as a real-time advisory tool. Improved control is demonstrated for Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) with the use of high-speed telemetry and physics-based models. Stabilizing and minimizing pressure within an acceptable bound leads to higher and more consistent Rate of Penetration (ROP). MPD control is challenging due to tight pressure windows and the nonlinearity of the choke and pump response on Bottom Hole Pressure (BHP). This work demonstrates a new Hammerstein-Wiener nonlinear model predictive controller for BHP regulation in drilling. Hammerstein-Wiener models employ input and output static nonlinear blocks before and after linear dynamics blocks and thereby simplify the controller design. The control performance is evaluated in scenarios such as drilling, pipe connections, and kick attenuation. A physics-based drilling simulator, WeMod, is used for model identification and control performance evaluation. The control performance of the new nonlinear controller is compared to conventional controllers in various scenarios. Because of the interconnected multivariable and nonlinear nature of the drilling operation, conventional controllers show severe limitations. In a first scenario, the performance of set point tracking during normal drilling operation is compared. By changing the set point of the BHP, the conventional controller manipulates only the choke valve opening while the nonlinear controller moves choke valve opening, mud pump, and back pressure pump simultaneously. In a second scenario, a pipe connection of a typical drillpipe stand is demonstrated. The conventional controller is not able to regulate the BHP by adjusting the choke valve only. Although a linear version of the controller is able to exploit multivariable relationships, absence of the nonlinear relationships results in severe oscillation when the operational range is shifted outside of the training region. The nonlinear controller maintains a BHP within ±1 bar of the requested set point. A third scenario investigates the kick attenuation performance of conventional and nonlinear control algorithms. The nonlinear controller attenuates the kick within well control conditions, without requiring a well shut-in procedure. Recent advances in drilling simulators and the reliability of the WDP data highway have enabled tighter BHP control. This study presents a robust method to control BHP by applying Hammerstein-Wiener models in an efficient model predictive controller. The proposed methods have been validated in the downstream industry, but are applied for the first time to drilling with nonlinear control functionality. The multivariable control adjusts three main manipulated variables in MPD simultaneously.

We used gradient-based optimization to demonstrate a method to optimize wind farms with varied hub heights. Our study includes a modified version of the FLORIS wake model that accommodates three-dimensional wakes integrated with a tower structural model. Our purpose was to design a process to minimize the cost of energy of a wind farm through layout optimization and varying turbine hub heights. Results indicate that when a farm is optimized for layout and height with two separate height groups, COE can be lowered by as much as 5-9%, compared to a similar layout and height optimization where all the towers are the same.

To safely avoid another aircraft, an unmanned aircraft must detect the intruder aircraft with ample time and distance to allow the ownship to track the intruder, perform risk assessment, plan an avoidance path, and execute the maneuver. This paper describes two analytical methods for finding the minimum detection range to ensure that these detection and avoidance steps can be carried out. The first method, time-based geometric velocity vectors, includes the bank-angle dynamics of the ownship; whereas the second, geometric velocity vectors, assumes an instantaneous bank-angle maneuver. The solution using the first method must be found numerically, whereas the second has a closed-form analytical solution. These methods are compared to two existing methods. The results show the time-based geometric velocity vectors approach is precise, the geometric velocity vectors approach is a good approximation under many conditions, and the two existing approaches are good approximations at large ownship speeds relative to the intruder speed, fast ownship bank-angle transients, and small ownship bank angles.

One of the most challenging earthquake-related hazards in the design of large infrastructure is liquefaction-induced lateral spread displacement. This paper presents a new simplified probabilistic approach to estimate lateral spread displacements at targeted return periods across large geographic areas using performance-based lateral spread displacement reference parameter maps and (if available) site-specific geotechnical information. The approach is demonstrated on a hypothetical pipeline extending from Rock Springs, Wyoming, to West Bountiful, Utah, in the United States. Advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed. The results of the demonstrative calculation show how the approach can be used to identify areas where additional geotechnical investigations might be needed, and how probabilistic lateral spread displacements can be easily predicted along numerous proposed alignments of the pipeline once geotechnical subsurface investigation and ground surveys become available. © 2017 ASCE.",,"Hazards; Pipelines; Geotechnical information; Geotechnical investigations; Lateral spread displacements; Linear infrastructure; Performance based; Probabilistic approaches; Reference parameters; Subsurface investigations; Seismic design",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020850797

The SYBAfeature descriptor is a robust algorithm that performs well with different degrees of image variation including: illumination, blurring, rotation, and perspective variations. The first step in detecting moving objects is to find the absolute difference between two image frames. To find the difference, the homography that describes the geometric relationship between the two frames is calculated using matched image feature points. The homography is then used to transform and align the images accurately. The transformed images are then used to calculate the absolute difference of the two images. It is then visually apparent where objects have moved or changed between the two images. Frame-to-frame object movement can be approximated to a linear process making the Kalman filter algorithm the best option. Once an object is lost, its corresponding track is deleted along with its corresponding motion model. During tracking, an object may be occluded by other objects in the scene. The MOT metric is designed to evaluate the performance of an object tracker by considering the tracking continuity, distance error for each path, and the reliability of detection. Thus, only the position of the object is considered in generating the MOT metric. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method and prove that the SYBA descriptor works well with various image deformations.",,"Tracking (position); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Absolute difference; Detecting moving objects; Feature descriptors; Frame differencing; Geometric relationships; Image feature points; Kalman filter algorithms; Moving object tracking; Object detection",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020233512

The goal of this study was to better understand this behavior for abutments backfilled with both gravel and geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS). Large-scale testing was performed with non-skewed and 30° skewed abutment configurations. Two tests were performed at each skew angle, one with gravel backfill and one with GRS backfill. The test abutment backwall was 3.35 m wide, non-skewed, and 1.68 m high and loaded laterally into the backfill. Both backfills exhibited greater passive resistance than sand backfills owing to increased internal friction angle and unit weight. Skew angle reduced the passive force in both cases by about 40%. The GRS backfills had reduced initial stiffness and only reached 79% to 87% of the passive force developed by the unreinforced gravel backfill. This reduction was considered to be a result of reduced interface friction at the geotextile-backwall interface due to wrapping. Reduced stiffness may be favorable for abutment configurations because it allows thermal movement without developing excessive induced stresses in the bridge superstructure. © ASCE.",,"Friction; Gravel; Reinforcement; Stiffness; Thermal expansion; Bridge superstructure; Expansion and contraction; Geosynthetic reinforced soils; Interface friction; Internal friction angle; Large scale testing; Passive resistance; Service conditions; Abutments (bridge)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018771049

The combined optimal controller and capital investment planner solves a large scale mixed integer nonlinear programming problem to provide the timing and size of the capacity investment (30 year outlook) and also guidance on the mode of operation (1 h time intervals).

These profiles are modulated using recycled flue gas that acts as the diluent normally served by nitrogen during air firing. The large amounts of recycled flue gas (RFG) required leads to efficiency losses, making the economics of this process less attractive. Oxy-coal combustion economics can be improved in advanced oxy-combustion processes that may involve zero or minimal RFG and possibly high combustion pressures. This paper addresses effects of high combustion temperatures resulting from minimal RFG, on ash aerosol formation and ash deposition mechanisms. Issues related to ash deposition play important roles in being able to predict overall boiler performance. Effects of high pressure will be reported in future work. A 100kW downfired laboratory combustor is used to compare ash aerosol formation and deposition under two conditions: 1) using 27% O2 in the inlet oxidant gas (denoted as OXY27), representing first generation oxy-combustion (heat transfer conditions similar to air firing for retrofit); 2) with 70% O2 in the inlet oxidant gas (denoted as OXY70), representing advanced oxy-combustion where the RFG is used only to transport the coal, not to modulate flame temperatures. The ash aerosol particle size distributions and its size segregated composition were determined using on-line electric mobility/light scattering analyzers and low pressure impactors, respectively. Their relationship to ash deposition rates as determined using a specially designed deposition probe was explored. The data show that, compared to the retrofit conditions of OXY27, the advanced oxy-coal combustion in OXY70 produce much higher concentrations of submicron particles due to increased mineral vaporization at the high flame temperature and the decreased flue gas flow rate. This appeared to lead to significant increases in deposition rates. Changes in the supermicron particle concentration were in line with those expected by the lower flue gas alone, suggesting that mineral fragmentation is not greatly affected by temperature. Deposition rates of both inside and outside deposits, as defined in earlier work, are interpreted in the light of recently developed hypotheses that point to the importance of the submicron particle ash concentration. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

GTR-STBC equipped with MMSE equalizer performs the best trade-offbetween the signal-tonoise ratio and inter-symbol interference by allocating unequal power over aeronautical telemetry channels. However, aeronautical telemetry channels are in general consists of larger delay spreads which make the MMSE equalization of aeronautical channels with GTR-STBC computationally complex. Interestingly enough, in spite of larger delays aeronautical channels are made of few sparsely distributed multipaths and therefore their MMSE equalizers are highly compressible. In this paper, compressed sensing based greedy algorithm is used for the design of sparse MMSE equalizer and a convex curve-fitting algorithm is used to find the sub-optimum power allocation parameter at the same sparsity level for GTR-STBC. Our simulation results show that 75-90% of the non-zero equalizer taps can be reduced with a slight relaxation of the mean-squared error (or equivalently slight degradation of bit-error rate performance). It is also observed that the optimum transmitter power profile for the sparse MMSE equalizer is different than that of the non-sparse equalizer.",,"Bit error rate; Block codes; Channel estimation; Curve fitting; Errors; Information theory; Mean square error; Space time codes; Space-time block coding (STBC); Telemetering; Telemetering equipment; Aeronautical telemetry; Bit error rate (BER) performance; Curve fitting algorithm; Greedy algorithms; Mean squared error; Minimum mean squared error equalizers; Optimum power allocations; Signaltonoise ratio (SNR); Equalizers",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041462867

A recent sensitivity analysis of a detailed char conversion model (Char Conversion Kinetics (CCK)) found thermal annealing to be an extremely sensitive submodel. In the present work, further analysis of the previous annealing model revealed significant disagreement with numerous data sets from experiments performed after that annealing model was developed. The annealing model was accordingly extended to reflect experimentally observed reactivity loss due to thermal annealing of a variety of coals in diverse char preparation conditions.

There is a need for improvement in the correlations between fire behavior on or near a slope and fire safety zones. An understanding of this effect could lead to more reliable guidelines for the establishment of firefighter safety zones, which are regions in wildfire areas that have been determined as safe for the survival of the firefighter.

Nanostructured platinum (Pt) catalyst was deposited onto the CNTs with a facile, electroless deposition method, resulting in a Pt-nanowire-coated, CNT sensor (PN-CNT). Convective mass transfer enhancement was shown to improve PN-CNT sensor performance in the non‐enzymatic, amperometric sensing of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In particular, convective enhancement was achieved through the use of high surface area to fluid volume structures and concentration boundary layer confinement in a channel. Stir speed and sensor orientation especially influenced the measured current in stirred environments for sensors with through-channel diameters of 16 μm. Through-flow sensing produced drastically higher signals than stirred sensing with over 90% of the H2O2being oxidized as it passed through the PN-CNT sensor, even for low concentrations in the range of 50 nM to 500 μM.

Mathematical models can facilitate process understanding and problem detection, and determine appropriate actions in case of mismatch between model and data. Furthermore, calculations may replace measurements where and when the latter are not available, as normally occurs during connections or when instruments or signal transmissions fail. However, advanced hydraulic models rely on a large set of inputs, such as pipe and wellbore geometry, various tuning parameters and fluid properties. The models are therefore time-consuming and difficult to configure in the field, where third-party experts may be needed at each well, to properly initiate the automation system and adjust it during the drilling process. Although the methods described in this paper are relevant to any critical drilling operation, they are applied to Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) as a widely deployed example of drilling automation. In MPD, hydraulic models predict downhole conditions and determine the requisite choke pressure for automatic adjustment. A new method for automatic configuration of key model parameters simplifies the tedious job of setting up the model and ensures that the automation system remains tuned to the well, even without onsite model tuning expertise. The proposed scheme is based on a simple method for separating inaccuracies due to co-linearity in frictional pressure losses and static mud weight. The search for optimal correction factors is based on a sequence of small oscillations of pump rate that can be applied during drilling without interrupting the operation. A massively parallel computing architecture improves the speed of the calibration algorithm proportional to the number of available CPU cores. A set of hydraulic model instances runs in parallel, allowing for efficient testing of changes in input signals within ranges of uncertainty. A method for selecting a subset of the best models that more accurately represent a given well is proposed. Computer simulations demonstrate how the novel calibration scheme allows automatic tuning of the friction factor and density correction factor, giving accurate prediction of the bottom hole pressure (BHP). The tuning scheme is run with a parallel architecture to demonstrate that correct values of unknown configuration parameters can be automatically determined sufficiently fast for real-time drilling control or as an advisory tool. The deployment of automation systems in drilling is hampered by the need for dedicated expert personnel to maintain systems that could have reduced the personnel needed on the rig.

The strong desire for developing miniaturized bioanalytic devices and instruments, in particular, has led to novel and powerful approaches to integrating optical elements and biological fluids on the same chip-scale system. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in optofluidic research with emphasis on applications in bioanalysis and a focus on waveguide-based approaches that represent the most advanced level of integration between optics and fluidics. We discuss recent work in photonically reconfigurable devices and various application areas. We show how optofluidic approaches have been pushing the performance limits in bioanalysis, e.g. in terms of sensitivity and portability, satisfying many of the key requirements for point-of-care devices. This illustrates how the requirements for bianalysis instruments are increasingly being met by the symbiotic integration of novel photonic capabilities in a miniaturized system. © 2017, Holger Schmidt et al.","Biosensing; integrated optics; lab-on-chip; optofluidics; photonics","Integrated optics; Photonics; Bioanalytic devices; Biosensing; Dynamic researches; Lab on chip; Level of integrations; Miniaturized systems; Opto-fluidics; Reconfigurable devices; Fluidics",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021404919

Metrics indicative of shock presence, specifically the skewness of the time derivative of the waveform, the average steepening factor, and a new wavelet-based metric called the shock energy fraction (SEF), are used to quantify the strength and prevalence of acoustic shocks within waveforms recorded 10-305 m from a tethered military aircraft. The derivative skewness is more sensitive to the presence of the largest and steepest shocks, while the ASF and SEF tend to emphasize aggregate behavior of the entire waveform. These metrics are applied at engine conditions ranging from 50% to 150% engine thrust request, over a wide range of angles and distances, to assess the growth and decay of shock waves. The responses of these metrics point to significant shock formation occurring through nonlinear propagation out to 76 m from the microphone array reference position. Although these strongest shocks decay, the metrics point to continued nonlinear propagation in the far-field, out to 305 m. Many of these features are accurately characterized using a nonlinear propagation scheme based on the Burgers equation, but this scheme fails to account for multipath interference and significant atmospheric effects over the long propagation distances, resulting in an overestimation of nonlinearity metrics. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A wavepacket is defined as a spatially extended source with an axial amplitude distribution that grows, saturates and decays, an axial phase relationship that produces directional noise, and correlation lengths longer than the integral length scales of the turbulent structures. This definition of a wavepacket has the same characteristics as the large-scale turbulent mixing noise; if the turbulent mixing noise can be isolated, the associate equivalent acoustic wavepacket—defined as a pressure fluctuation on a cylinder around the jet nozzle—can be found. An estimate of the frequencydependent, spatial variation in the large-scale turbulent mixing noise comes from a similarity spectra decomposition of the measured autospectral density, which in turn leads to data-educed wavenumber axial spectra associated with the frequency-dependent equivalent wavepackets. This wavepacket eduction technique has been applied to acoustical measurements of an unheated, Mach 1.8 jet in the near and far fields. At both locations, the resulting frequency-dependent, data-educed wavenumber spectra exhibit different types of self-similarity for low and high frequency regimes that become apparent when the axial wavenumber is scaled by the acoustic wavenumber, with a transition band between the two regimes. As expected, the data-educed wavenumber spectra can be used to predict field levels in the dominant radiation lobe. Addition of an uncorrelated source distribution, derived from the similarity spectra decomposition associated with the fine-scale turbulent mixing noise, creates a model that accounts for the sideline levels. This field-prediction ability of the wavepacket-plus-uncorrelated-distribution model is tested using the near and far field measurements. When predicting the field at the other location, the model’s average error is less than 2 dB for St = 0.04-0.25 but increases for larger St because the apparent directivity changes from near to far field, likely due to the frequency dependence of the extended source region. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A multiple-wavepacket (MWP) model provides an analytical framework for jet-noise-like radiation to simulate jet noise field levels as well as the corresponding spatial coherence properties within the field. Here, a beamforming method with regularization is applied to noise measured by a linear array near a high-performance military aircraft. Beamforming results are decomposed into a reduced-order MWP model and the predicted radiation is validated in terms of level and coherence properties using benchmark measurements. Sound levels and coherence lengths generated by the beamforming results show good agreement with benchmark measurements over a range of frequencies that contribute significantly to the overall radiation. The MWP model is shown to predict full-scale specific features such as multilobe directivity patterns, and the addition of an uncorrelated distribution (UD) model adequately predicts the sideline radiation that is otherwise difficult to reproduce from wavepacket radiation. The MWP model predicted radiation characteristics are an improvement over single-wavepacket models, which do not incorporate spatiotemporal features of the radiation. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Coronary stents currently have two major complications: restenosis and thrombosis. CI-CNT stents may provide improved clinical outcomes for both of these issues. Multiple stent design concepts were generated, evaluated, and two stent designs were selected: one with a semi-auxetic nature, and one designed for maximum force. These designs were further developed and optimized using analytical tools along with finite element analysis. Planar versions of the stent designs were manufactured and mechanically tested to verify performance. The performance of the cylindrical stent configurations was analyzed using finite element modeling. A sample cylindrical stent was also fabricated. This research demonstrates that feasible coronary stent designs can be manufactured from CI-CNTs. However, a major challenge for CI-CNT stent designs is meeting the design requirement of sufficient radial force. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Carbon nanotubes; Microfabrication; Vascular stent","Carbon nanotubes; Diseases; Finite element method; Implants (surgical); Microfabrication; Nanotubes; Yarn; Analytical tool; Clinical outcome; Coronary stents; Filled carbon nanotubes; Maximum forces; Radial forces; Stent configurations; Vascular stents; Stents",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989819889

However, a clear measure of influence with respect to leader position is not adequately studied. Studies with animal systems have shown that leaders who exert strong couplings may be located in front, where they provide energy benefits, or in the middle, where they can be seen by a larger section of the group. In this paper, we systematically vary number of leaders and leader positions in simulated robotic swarms of two different sizes, and assess their effect on steering effectiveness and energy expenditure. In particular, we analyze the effect of placing leaders in the front, middle, and periphery, on the time to converge and lateral acceleration of a swarm of robotic agents as it performs a single turn to reach the desired goal direction. Our results show that swarms with leaders in the middle and periphery take less time to converge than swarms with leaders in the front, while the lateral acceleration between the three placement strategies is not different. We also find that the time to converge towards the goal direction reduces with the increase in percentage of leaders in the swarm, although this value decays slowly beyond the percentage of leaders at 30%. As the swarm size is increased, we find that the leaders in the periphery become less effective in reducing the time to converge.

The compressible material is typically expanded polystyrene or geofoam. Little guidance is available on the development of passive force with an inclusion. To explore this issue, large-scale passive force tests were conducted with and without a geofoam inclusion acting as a barrier between the backfill soil and a simulated bridge abutment. The presence of the geofoam inclusion reduced the passive force by 70% relative to the sand backfill alone. Although the measured force and failure geometry appeared to conform to a log-spiral mechanism when only sand backfill was used, the geofoam inclusion transforms the failure geometry to a Rankine failure mechanism. This suggests that the geofoam acted to reduce the interface friction between the wall and the backfill sand thereby reducing the passive resistance. © ASCE.",,"Pressure distribution; Retaining walls; Compressible material; Expanded polystyrene; Failure mechanism; Geofoam inclusions; Interface friction; Large scale tests; Lateral earth pressure; Passive resistance; Abutments (bridge)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018773829

Predictive CFD simulations are valuable tools in evaluating and deploying oxy-fuel and other carbon capture technologies either as retrofit technologies or for new construction. However, accurate predictive simulations require physically realistic submodels with low computational requirements. In particular, comprehensive char oxidation and gasification models have been developed that describe multiple reaction and diffusion processes. This work extends a comprehensive char conversion code (CCK), which treats surface oxidation and gasification reactions as well as the processes such as film diffusion, pore diffusion, ash encapsulation, and annealing. In this work several submodels in the CCK code were updated with more realistic physics or otherwise extended to function in oxycoal conditions. Improved submodels include the annealing model, the swelling model, the mode of burning parameter, and the kinetic model, as well as the addition of the Chemical Percolation Devolatilization (CPD) model. Results of the char combustion model are compared to oxy-coal data, and further compared to parallel data sets near conventional conditions. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

Specifically lighter, lower temperature materials such as aluminum or magnesium can be joined to higher temperature materials such as steel and titanium. The scribe portion of the modified friction stir welding pin tool creates in situ mechanical interlocks at the material interface. This mechanical interlocking, or hook-like interface morphology, has shown promising joint strength. However, this morphology can vary along a weld length and is sensitive to joining and tooling parameters. The current work seeks to determine the sensitivity of joint strength to the morphology of the hook interface and predict joint strength based on key morphology parameters. Key morphology features of the hooks extracted from joined samples are varied to quantify their impact on simulated lap shear strength. Predictable joint strength is key to wide spread use of this technique. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","Friction stir scribe joining","Dissimilar materials; Friction; Hooks; Interfaces (materials); Joining; Morphology; Tribology; Friction stir; Interface morphologies; Lap shear strength; Lower temperatures; Material interfaces; Mechanical interlock; Mechanical interlocking; Morphology parameters; Friction stir welding",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042296364

One of the purposes of these products is to improve the consumer's quality of life. Currently, there is no established method of measuring the social impact of these types of products. As a result, engineers have used their own metrics to assess their product's impact, if at all. Some of the common metrics used include products sold and revenue, which measure the financial success of a product without recognizing the social successes or failures it might have. In this paper we introduce a potential metric, the Product Impact Metric (PIM), which quantifies the impact a product has on impoverished individuals - especially those living in developing countries. It measures social impact broadly in five dimensions: Health, education, standard of living, employment quality, and security. The PIM is inspired by the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) created by the United Nations Development Programme. The MPI measures how the depth of poverty within a nation changes year after year, and the PIM measures how an individual's quality of life changes after being affected by an engineered product. The Product Impact Metric can be used to predict social impacts (using personas that represent real individuals) or measure social impacts (using specific data from products introduced into the market). © 2017 ASME.",,"Computer aided design; Design; Developing countries; Engineered products; Financial success; Impact metric; Quality of life; Social impact; Standard of living; United nations development programme; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034637111

Some events spawned tsunamis with run-up heights >15 m that swept many coastal villages away. 2004 marked the recurrence of some of these events in western Indonesia. However, there has not been a major shallow earthquake (M ≥ 8) in Java and eastern Indonesia for the past 160 years. During this time of relative quiescence, enough tectonic strain energy has accumulated across several active faults to cause major earthquake and tsunami events, such as those documented in the historical records presented here.

The potential benefits of an origami-based solution created an opportunity for application on NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) to protect sensitive parts from debris. Origami-based bellows were designed to fit spatial limitations and meet needed compression ratios. Designs have demonstrated high mass reductions, improved stroke length, greatly decreased stowed volume, improved flexibility, and reduced reaction forces in comparison with traditional metal bellows. A nylon-reinforced polyvinyl fluoride based bellows with an aramid fiber stitched seam is well suited for debris containment in space conditions. Various epoxies maintained an adequate bond with polyvinyl fluoride below expected environmental temperature for bellows mounting. Asymmetric compression of the bellows occurs at extreme low temperatures and is preventable by balancing stiffness within the structure. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

As the world’s most important fiber crop species, Gossypium hirsutum belongs to the allotetraploid Gossypium clade that consists of six additional species. The lint fiber evolved only once in the history of Gossypium, in the ancestor diploid A-genome species, and this trait was passed on to the allopolyploid species when the A-genome united in a common nucleus with a D-genome from the other ancestor that produced no lint fibers. The domestication history of G. hirsutum involved the collection and use of lint fibers by indigenous people for the purpose of making strings and other textile products; hence, spinnable lint fibers were likely to have evolved under domestication. The geographical distribution of G. hirsutum overlaps with G. barbadense and G. mustelinum, and gene flow among these species has been documented. Therefore, the introgression of novel alleles into G. hirsutum possibly contributed to greater ecological adaptation in colonizing new habitats and providing important sources of genetic variation for artificial selection in the early domestication efforts. In modern Upland cotton, numerous germplasm lines have been developed from crossing with G. barbadense. However, reproductive barriers such as reduced fertility, segregation distortion, and hybrid breakdown are often observed in later generation hybrids between G. hirsutum and the other polyploid species, complicating the task of introgressing new, stably inherited allelic variation from inter specific hybridization. Recent efforts in molecular genetic research have provided insights into the location and effects of QTLs from wild species that are associated with traits important to cotton production. These and future research efforts will undoubtedly provide the tools that can be utilized by plant breeders to access novel genes from wild and domesticated allotetraploid Gossypium for Upland cotton improvement. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030752712

Current methods to accomplish this have prohibitively long lead times due to extensive sample preparation. This work details the use of quantum dots thermomarkers to measure the surface temperature of thin fibers in a non-contact manner and determine the fibers’ thermal diffusivity. Neural networks are trained on extracting the temperature of a sample from fluorescence spectra in calibrated, steady-state conditions, based on different spectral features such as peak intensity and peak wavelength. The trained neural networks are then used to reconstruct the evolution of the surface temperature in transient heating experiments. In order to determine the thermal properties of a thin fiber, modulated laser heating is applied and an FFT-based method is used to extract the phase and amplitude response of the temperature field at the modulation frequency. The spatiotemporal dependence of the fluorescence signal, obtained by scanning the distance between the excitation and detection laser spots and varying the frequency response due to an axial scan and a frequency scan, is then curve-fit to the resulting decay curves by a photothermal model in order to determine the thermal diffusivity of the fiber. The measured thermal diffusivity (3.3 ± 0.8 × 10−7 m2 s−1) of a synthetic spider silk fiber by the current method has similar properties to other synthetic silk fibers, and demonstrates the ability of the current method to more rapidly measure thermophysical properties of thin fibers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","FFT; Neural networks; Photothermal; Quantum dots; Thermal diffusivity; Thermometry","Atmospheric temperature; Diffusion; Fast Fourier transforms; Fluorescence; Frequency response; Laser excitation; Nanocrystals; Neural networks; Silk; Surface properties; Thermal diffusivity; Thermometers; Fluorescence spectra; Modulation frequencies; Photo-thermal; Steady-state condition; Surface temperatures; Synthetic silk fibers; Thermometry; Trained neural networks; Semiconductor quantum dots; Detection; Fluorescence; Lasers; Neural Networks",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019570356

Surface strains were measured using a digital image correlation method in order to ensure that biaxial stretching was achieved. The punch height versus load curve was found to be the same for temperatures of 25 and for 50, °C, while at 75, °C the load for a given punch height was less. This difference seems to indicate a change in deformation mechanism between 50 and 75, °C. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) was used to quantify features of the microstructure in the as-received and the strained specimens. Rather than a sudden transition from twinning to slip at low temperatures, it appears that twinning gradually decreases and slip activity increases as temperatures rise across the range from 25 to 125, °C. This confirms recent predictions found in the literature. The twin activity predominantly involves the formation of compression twins which rapidly transform further to create secondary twins for easier strain accommodation. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","Formability; Magnesium alloy; Microstructure","Formability; Magnesium; Magnesium printing plates; Microstructure; Strain; Biaxial stretching; Biaxial tensions; Deformation mechanism; Digital image correlation methods; Electron back scatter diffraction; Low temperatures; Strain accommodations; Surface strains; Magnesium alloys",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042303226

As such, it is a useful representation for complex networks where a coarse description of global system structure is desired without detailing the intricacies of a full state realization. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding a minimal state realization for a given dynamical structure function. Interestingly, some dynamical structure functions require uncontrollable modes in their state realizations to deliver the desired input-output behavior while respecting a specified system structure. As a result, the minimal order necessary to realize a particular dynamical structure function may be greater than that necessary to realize its associated transfer function. Although finding a minimal realization for a given dynamical structure function is difficult in general, we present a straightforward procedure here that works for a simplified class of systems. © 2014 IEEE.","Linear systems; minimal realization theory; systems biology","Complex networks; Structured programming; Causal dependencies; Dynamical structure; Input-output behavior; Linear time-invariant system; Minimal realizations; State realizations; System structures; Systems biology; Linear systems",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027510131

Dryland farming is less dense but important in nearly every state in the western U.S and in northern and central Mexico. In addition to wheat, North American dryland farming is important for the production of maize (Zea maize L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), pulses, and oilseeds. The traditional and still prevalent cropping system is a two-year rotation of wheat and summer fallow. In this traditional practice, shallow tillage is used during fallow periods to control weeds and help store moisture in the soil. Sustainability of this practice is limited by soil degradation and erosion and poor water use efficiency. Where adopted, no-till practices improve precipitation storage and use efficiency, which has led to crop intensification and diversification and improvements in soil properties. This chapter highlights some current issues for dryland cropping in North America including integrated pest management for herbicide resistant weeds, diversification of crop rotations, soil carbon dynamics and residue management, and the application of models to aid decision making. Sustaining the dryland cropping systems of North America depends on research and application of practices that reverse past soil degradation, increase cropping system diversity, and apply integrated pest management strategies. Both experimental and modelling approaches are needed to address these challenges. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Crop diversification; Cropping systems models; Dryland cropping systems; Herbicide resistant weeds; No-till; Residue management","Crops; Efficiency; Herbicides; Soils; Water conservation; Weed control; Crop diversification; Cropping systems; Dryland cropping systems; Herbicide resistant weeds; No-till; Residue management; Decision making",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014996411
